<p>MacStories has a <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/macstories-guide-design-and-launch-your-own-imessage-sticker-pack-on-the-app-store/">full writeup / tutorial</a> on how to design and launch your own iMessage sticker pack.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I don't know how to code, but I do have some design skills, and I wanted to see what it was like to create something for iOS and launch it on the App Store. So a few months ago I decided that I would make some sticker packs for iOS 10 â€“ and that's what I did. I brainstormed possible ideas, started designing some stickers and ultimately ended up publishing Birthday Celebration Stickers and an app bundle which included World Flag Stickers and a few other country-specific flag stickers.</p>
<p>  The process of making and publishing these sticker packs was fairly straightforward, but I also encountered some unexpected hurdles. To help others who are excited about making their own sticker packs, I've written this guide, which I hope can make the process a little smoother.
