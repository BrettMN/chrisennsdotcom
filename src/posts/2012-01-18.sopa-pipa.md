<p>Personally I think blacking out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2">websites</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanbaldwin/status/159671559450132480">tweets</a> and <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2012/01/18/pipa-sopa/">photos</a> isn't the best way to protest something that could do exactly that - better to go out and make and share content showing what is possible now and explain how that might go away.</p>
<p>Which is what this video by <a href="http://vimeo.com/kirbyferguson">Kirby Ferguson</a><sup id="fnref-19991:1"><a href="#fn-19991:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> does a great job of. Explain what's at stake</p>

<p>SOPA and PIPA are American issues now but if enacted would certainly affect us all a great deal. And there's a pretty good history of Canada attempting to simply follow along with the entertainment/government of the USA so it's a good idea to be informed about what's going on down south.</p>
