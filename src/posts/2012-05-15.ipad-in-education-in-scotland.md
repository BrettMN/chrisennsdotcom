<p>Cedars, a school in Scotland, is profiled in one of <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/education/resources/profiles.html#profiles-cedars">Apple's Education Profiles videos</a> talking about the impact of a 1:1 iPad implementation for the students featuring <a href="http://fraserspeirs.com/">Fraser Speirs</a>.</p>
<p>I first learned about Fraser years ago, back when iPhoto was introduced and shortly thereafter there became a need to export from iPhoto to a Flickr account. Fraser's <a href="http://connectedflow.com/flickrexport/">FlickrExport</a> was (and still is) the best Flickr export plugin for <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fiphoto%252Fid408981381%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">iPhoto (MAS link)</a> and now <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Faperture%252Fid408981426%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Aperture (MAS link)</a>.</p>
<p>He also writes on <a href="http://speirs.org/">his blog</a> about his other life as an educator navigating the changing waters of education and technology.</p>
