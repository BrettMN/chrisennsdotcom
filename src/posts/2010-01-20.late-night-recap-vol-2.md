<p>More recaps from the whole Leno vs Conan debacle <a href="http://tv.gawker.com/5452391/as-obrien-laughs-in-the-face-of-nbc-and-lenos-attacks-once-again-turn-personal-letterman-unleashes-vintage-jay">here</a>.</p>
<p>Summary:  Letterman is having a blast with this.  Conan is at his best when he's the underdog.  And Jay just seems as slimy as you'd think an LA talk show host would be.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2010/01/16/conan-vs-jay/">the previous post for more fun (or petty?) stuff.</a></p>
