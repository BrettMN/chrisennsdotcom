<p>Well it seems jolly 'ole England was very good to Lindsay. As you can read below, he got himself engaged there. The lucky girl is Christine Jennings.</p>
<p>So send your congratulations off to Linds. They're planning for a June 2003 wedding in England so start saving your pennies and watching for seat sales!</p>
