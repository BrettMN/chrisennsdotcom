<p>In summary, <a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20120622/BUSINESS/206220340">not very much</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The annual cost to charge an iPad is just $1.36, according to the Electric Power Research Institute...</p>
<p>  By comparison, a 60-watt compact fluorescent bulb costs $1.61, a desktop PC adds up to $28.21 and a refrigerator runs you $65.72.
