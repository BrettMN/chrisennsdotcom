<p>Looks like <a href="http://www.dirtconference.com/">this</a> could be a good antidote for the <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2009/10/07/becoming-willowback/">previous post</a>, in a slightly ironic way.  Hey, at least it's not an actual Willowback conference, right?</p>

<p>Also a great excuse to go further south as winter has arrived.</p>
