This was a very big deal in our house this morning. Making sure all the devices were getting the 15GB+ update to [Fortnite for Season 3](https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2020/6/17/21294116/fortnite-new-battle-pass-skins-price-end-date-aquaman-umbrella-knight-trailer):

> Fortnite’s newest season is here, and that means a whole slew of new skins to unlock through the battle pass. This season’s pass has a distinctly nautical theme, which makes sense now that the entire map is flooded, but there’s more than just ocean accessories to unlock this time around.
