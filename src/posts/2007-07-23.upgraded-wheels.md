<p>Damien got an upgraded set of wheels on the weekend.  We picked up a <a href="http://www.chariotcarriers.com/">Chariot</a> and had a great time trying it out around Waskesiu on the weekend.</p>

<p>It's got decent acceleration and corners pretty good.  We're going to take it out and try and do some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drifting_%28motorsport%29">drifting</a> tonight.</p>
