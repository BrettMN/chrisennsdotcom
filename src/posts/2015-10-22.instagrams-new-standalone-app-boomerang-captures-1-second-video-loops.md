<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/22/instagram-boomerang/">Boomerang looks interesting</a> in the same way Hyperlapse and Layouts are great apps - a single purpose, focused app that does one thing well but doesn't clutter up the main Instagram app:</p>
<blockquote><p>...today it’s launching Boomerang on iOS and Android. It’s a dead-simple app where you shoot a one-second burst of five photos that are turned into a silent video that plays forwards and then reverses over and over in a loop.</p></blockquote>
