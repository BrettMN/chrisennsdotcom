From The New York Times - [Churches Were Eager to Reopen. Now They Are a Major Source of Coronavirus Cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/us/coronavirus-churches-outbreaks.html):

> In Texas, Pastor Ron Arbaugh said his church, the Calvary Chapel of San Antonio, had followed “the letter of the law” and tried to practice social distancing since it was allowed to reopen in May. The ushers, greeters and leaders of the children’s ministry wore face masks. Families sat spaced out in the pews. About half the congregation wore masks.
> 
> But now, about 50 congregants and staff members — including the pastor and his wife — have tested positive for the coronavirus. Mr. Arbaugh said all the cases had been mild so far.

I really don't get the rush to gather again. I understand that it's good, fun, and nice to get together with your friends, family, and church members. Except for the huge risk right now with a deadly virus going around that spreads in ways that a typical church gathering seems to be best suited to help:

> “It’s an ideal setting for transmission,” said Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert at Emory University, referring to church gatherings. “You have a lot of people in a closed space. And they’re speaking loudly, they’re singing. All those things are exactly what you don’t want.”
