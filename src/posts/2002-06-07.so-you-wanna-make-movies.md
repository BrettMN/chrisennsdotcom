<p>o as I'm doing a bunch of Apple training here at work, I'm realizing once again how much I'd really like a Mac - if we could afford one.</p>
<p>Powermac G4 933 - $3,169<br />
17" Apple Studio Display - $1,199<br />
Sony DCRTRV740 Video Camera - $1,099<br />
Final Cut Pro - $449<br />
DVD Studio Pro - $819<br />
Firewire Cable - $12<br />
All for only $6,747 ($7,624 w/taxes)</p>
<p>You can even throw in an extra $1500 for a DigiDesign Digi001 and be setup for video and audio production.</p>
<p>Well, all I can really do is put it on my Christmas list I guess. :)</p>
<p>(note: all prices are education pricing only and are available at The Campus Computer Store. :) )</p>
