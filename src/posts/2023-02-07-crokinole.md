Over in the [ShopTalk Show D-d-d-d-discord](https://www.patreon.com/shoptalkshow), [Chris](https://chriscoyier.net) randomly stumbled on [Crokinole.ca](https://crokinole.ca) with a confused / amazed "what on earth is this CANADA?", which was followed by a discussion with people familiar with it ("I grew up playing this at my grandparents. It's a fun flicking game that always is a hit."), and those who were not ("As a life long Canadian I do not claim this nor know what it is.").

Two people commented that they'd somewhat randomly seen videos on YouTube about Crokinole, including [this great review of the game on the Shut Up & Sit Down channel](https://youtu.be/XMKzeg78peg), posted 3 years ago.
