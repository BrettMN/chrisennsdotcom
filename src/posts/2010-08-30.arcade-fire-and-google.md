<p>HTML5 killed the MP3 star?  Make sure you're using <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google's Chrome web browser</a> and then load up <a href="http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/">http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/</a>.</p>
<p>They build an interactive video using an address you put in, pulling images and data from Google Maps/etc.  Don't be alarmed by all the browser windows opening up and closing - that's just part of the "experience."</p>
