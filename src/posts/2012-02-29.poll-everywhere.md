title: "Poll Everywhere"

<p><a href="http://www.polleverywhere.com/">Poll Everywhere</a> looks like an interesting idea for schools or other presentation focused businesses or organizations.</p>
<p>Plus it's got a sweet promo video produced by Adam Lisagor's <a href="http://sandwichvideo.com/">Sandwich Video</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/37674303">Direct link to video</a></p>
<p>I really like that they include <a href="http://www.polleverywhere.com/macpresenter">the ability to embed a result live in a Keynote or Powerpoint presentation</a> so that you don't have to switch out to a web page mid-presentation. Also, Canada is <a href="http://www.polleverywhere.com/international">included in their list of short code supported countries</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.polleverywhere.com/plans">Pricing</a> will either look crazy to you (<em>"What? Why would I pay a monthly fee to ask people something?"</em>) or be a tremendous value to you if you've ever had to pay for, setup and configure a polling system.</p>
