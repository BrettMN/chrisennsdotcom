<p>I don't think this is an attempt by <a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/04/in-defense-of-twitter">Jason  Kottke</a> to convince you to use/like Twitter (or whatever <strong>it</strong> is at the moment), but just to try and show you why people might enjoy using it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ever since the web hit the mainstream sometime in the 90s, people have asked of each new conversational publishing technology -- newsgroups, message boards, online journals, weblogs, social networking sites, and now Twitter -- the same question: "but why would anyone want to hear about what some random person is eating for breakfast?" The answer applies equally well for both offline conversation and online "social media": almost no one...except for their family and friends.</p></blockquote>
