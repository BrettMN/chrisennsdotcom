<p>If <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/02/09/apple-to-announce-ipad-3-first-week-of-march/">the beard says so</a>, then you can take it to the bank.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Sources say the company has chosen the first week in March to debut the successor to the iPad 2, and will do so at one of its trademark special events. The event will be held in San Francisco, presumably at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, Appleâ€™s preferred location for big announcements like these.
