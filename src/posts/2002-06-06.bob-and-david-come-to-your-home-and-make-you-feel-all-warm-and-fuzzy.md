<p>In the "This Humour Is Not For Everyone" category, the Mr. Show DVD comes out this week. Here's a bit of a lowdown on what's coming:</p>
<p>"Watch Bob and David push the envelope until you want to scream, "Leave that poor envelope alone!" The 2-disc set includes 288 Minutes of "Mr. Show" episodes plus bonus features (in glorious full color and Dolby Surround sound)."</p>
<p>It includes the full first two seasons of Mr. Show. I know of at least 1 of my many, many friends that I have that will be buying this. And I have many friends, let me tell you.</p>
