<p>I'm testing out a client based blogging program called <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/ecto/">ecto</a>.  It's by the same guy that made the iTunes recently played list I'm using on the right hand side of my blog.  Currently it's a OS X only program but they are working on a Windows version apparently.</p>
<p>I think I'm going to have to start a Roll Up the Rim counter like I remember some blogger doing last time they had this contest.  I'm up to at least 10 cups of java purchased and still no win.  I'm thinking they see me coming and pull out all the duds.  I just know that some guy right before me is going to win a plasma tv and someone after me will win the truck and I'll get a "Please Play Again" cup.  Grrrr.</p>
