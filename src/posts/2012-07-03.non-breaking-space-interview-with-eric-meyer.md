<p>My <a href="http://lemonproductions.ca">business</a> is in an industry that's still relatively new - it really didn't exist when I graduated from high school - there are people who were around when it started and helped set the direction and tone of how we as builders of the web would do what we're doing.</p>

<p>Eric Meyer is one of those people and we got a chance to <a href="http://nonbreakingspace.tv/eric-meyer/">interview him for the latest Non-Breaking Space episode</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Eric has been working with the web since late 1993 and is an internationally recognized expert on the subjects of HTML, CSS, and web standards. A widely read author, he is the founder of <a href="http://complexspiral.com/">Complex Spiral Consulting</a>, which counts a wide variety of corporations, educational institutions, and government agencies among its clients. Eric, along with <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>, is the co-founder of <a href="http://aneventapart.com/">An Event Apart</a>.

<p>It was my great pleasure to be able to sit in on the interview. If you're at all interested in web design, I'd encourage you to <a href="http://nonbreakingspace.tv/eric-meyer/">go listen to the show</a>.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="http://l.ssktn.com/mJHd/play">listen to a bit of the after show where he teaches me about paying attention to details</a>.</p>
