<p>Spoiler alert: Executives at major chocolate bar manufacturers have no morals.</p>
<blockquote><p>Every October, American kids like mine are treated to a wide array of chocolates—Snickers, Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, Butterfingers—because hundreds of thousands of children in West Africa are enslaved harvesting cocoa beans. These children are performing this work for the benefit of most of the mainstream chocolate providers in the United States. A report from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast and other African countries estimated there were 284,000 children working on cocoa farms in hazardous conditions. Many of them have been taken from their families and sold as servants. </p></blockquote>

<p>This is what happens when everyone passes the buck on to the "corporation" rather than talking about say<br />
John P. Bilbrey (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hershey_Company">President and CEO of Hershey</a>). Somehow it's more comforting for everyone if it's a company name rather than what it really is.</p>
