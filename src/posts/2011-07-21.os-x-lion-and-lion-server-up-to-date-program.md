<p>If you bought a Mac after June 06th, 2011 and it did't come with Lion pre-installed you can visit <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/uptodate/">www.apple.com/macosx/uptodate/</a> to get a free upgrade to Lion via the Apple Online Store & Mac App Store.</p>
<p>One item in the fine print is that you must submit your request within 30 days of your original purchase. </p>
