<p>Brought to you by The Office.</p>
<p>On hearing that it's Tim's 30th birthday:</p>
<p><strong>David Brent (the boss):</strong> Things do change.  It could be worse. There's a neighbour of mine, Calvin, he's 32 and he still lives with his parents.<br />
<strong>Tim Canterbury:</strong> I live with my parents.<br />
<strong>David:</strong> Cherish them... really. Because you'll miss them when they're not around.  Both of mine are dead.<br />
<strong>Tim:</strong> Oh<br />
<strong>David</strong> Well, dad isn't... dead.  He's in a home. So, as good as.<br />
...<br />
<strong>David:</strong> Anyway...  he is a vegetable now.. and that's something we all got to look forward to.  Happy birthday.</p>
