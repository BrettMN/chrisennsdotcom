<p>At the end of their recent Nashville show, Bono notices a fan - who happens to be blind - holding up a sign that says he would love to play a song for his wife. Bono brings him up on stage and starts singing 'All I Want is You' with him, eventually the whole band joins in.</p>
<p>After the song, Bono sends him away with his custom built Gretsch tele. A <a href="http://blog.forevercaptive.com/post/4250365248/tele-for-bono-and-other-custom-shop-pieces" title="" target="">beautiful guitar</a> and an amazing experience for this fan.</p>
