<p>U2's June 23rd, 2010 show has been officially rescheduled to June 1st, 2011.  A year is a long time from now - who knows what we'll be doing?  Our tickets are still good for this show and with any luck they'll have some new music out by then that we'll get to sample.</p>
<p>Here's U2's apology video for the tour rescheduling:</p>
