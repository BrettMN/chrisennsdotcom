<p>U2 is this week's guest on a podcast called Song Exploder that takes a song and breaks it down with the artist(s) who wrote it, getting them to talk through what inspired them and how it was all put together.</p>
<p>The Edge talks about how he uses Garageband as a sketchpad along with loops put together by U2 drummer Larry Mullen Jr. to mess around with ideas - and eventually putting them together with a different set of lyrics by Bono than what they had originally recorded.</p>
<p>From what I've read and seen over the years, it's a fairly common process for how a U2 song is put together - pieces are moved from one idea to another, lyrics are rewritten, solos redone. I don't think U2 gets enough credit for the care and attention to detail that they put into songs and the subsequent tour. As <a href="http://goodstuff.fm/dailyish/105">I discussed with Matt McGee on Daily(ish) #105</a>, they don't just put together a greatest hits song list for their tour - each song is put in it's place with lots of thought.</p>
