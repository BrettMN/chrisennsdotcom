<p>I use (<a href="https://chrisenns.com/recommends/freshbooks/">and recommend you use</a>) <a href="https://lemonproductions.freshbooks.com/refer/www">FreshBooks</a> for invoicing and tracking of expenses at <a href="http://www.lemonproductions.ca/">Lemon Productions</a> and they just added the ability to import PDFs as a receipt. So scan a copy of your receipt to PDF and attach it to your expense report and then never worry about having to store and find a paper copy of your receipts again.</p>

<p>As an added bonus, keep a copy of all your scanned or photographed receipts in a folder in <a href="http://db.tt/czHe7sK">your free Dropbox account</a> and you'll have a backup stored in the cloud in case your computer ever disappears.</p>

<p>Even better, if you take photos of your receipts with a <a href="http://evernote.com/">free Evernote account</a> on your iPhone and you'll be able to easily search the text of your receipts later thanks to Evernote OCR'ing (recognizing the text in your images) your receipt.</p>

<p>Like magic.</p>
