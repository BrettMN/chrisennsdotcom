<p>I just installed the Movabletype upgrade to v3.14.  Any mennoboys or mennogirls that experience any issues, <a href="mailto:chris.enns@mac.com">drop me a line</a>.</p>
<p>Any Mac users out there who use Movabletype and are missing out on the shortcut link, bold, email, etc buttons on their entry page need to check out <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=0&amp;t=76">Firefox</a>.  Even if all you use it for is your blog entries, it's a good browser to have around.  Something in the javascript support in Safari renders those shortcut buttons invisible.</p>
