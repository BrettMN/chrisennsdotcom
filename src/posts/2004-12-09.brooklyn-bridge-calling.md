<p>Sometimes things happen that makes you wonder why it took so long for it to happen.  U2 has released <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=35792448">part of their free concert in Brooklyn</a> (near Brooklyn?  What do I know, I don't live in New York) on the iTunes music store.  Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.thetradersden.org/forums/showthread.php?t=1143">I'm downloading a DVD of the concert from Bittorrent.</a></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how much of the music from their tour next year gets thrown online via iTunes.  Hopefully other artists start getting the special treatment from Apple/iTunes.  I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I love hearing different versions of songs, especially live, when a band experiments a bit.</p>
