<blockquote><p>But in a brief period of questionable judgment yesterday, I impulse-bought the new MacBook, which I call the MacBook One.1 My theory was that I could use it for roles in which I’ve failed to use iPads because they don’t work for me: writing and email around the house or in bed, and bringing on most trips that wouldn’t involve Xcode. It would be my iPad Pro. I’ve been waffling for years about finding a cheap 11-inch MacBook Air to serve this role, but I didn’t want a non-Retina machine.</p></blockquote>

<p>I've tried the new MacBook in a store and I didn't mind the keyboard and trackpad - but that's quite different from day to day use. I'm disappointed to hear how slow it is.</p>
