<p>Whew.  The retreat this weekend wiped me out - and I wasn't even an 'official' leader this time.  There were some really cool kids that I got to meet this weekend..  with some crazy names.  Kenia, Adan, Naamen.  I'm just guessing on the spelling because I never actually saw them written down.  I also did a good job of promoting (evangelising?) Apple on the retreat.  I was just diddling around with <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/ilife/garageband/">Garageband</a> and then few kids started to wonder what I was doing.  Pretty soon, half the kids were wanting a Apple so they could make their own music.  heh heh.</p>
<p>Sue will have the pictures up later - I'll link them once they're up.</p>
