<p>An answer to many a parent's prayer when trying to get video of their kid doing the cutestthingeveromgdidyouseethat only to have to wait for the Camera app to start-up, by which point your kid has stopped doing the cutestthingeveromgdidyouseethat.</p>

Your video gets added to the default Camera Roll just like the native Camera app. Slick.</p>
