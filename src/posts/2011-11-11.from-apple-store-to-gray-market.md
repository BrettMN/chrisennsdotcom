<p>Professional queuers (people paid to line up and buy stuff), regular folks buying 5 iPhone 4S at a time just to turn around and sell them to the gray market as soon as they leave the store, making around $140 per iPhone 4S.</p>
<p>Apple tries to do what it can to stop the scalpers and resellers - but you can see how futile it is when nearly everyone is doing it.</p>
