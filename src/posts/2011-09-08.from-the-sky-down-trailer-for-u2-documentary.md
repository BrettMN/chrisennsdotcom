<p>Achtung Baby is when I fell in love with U2. There's a term for fans of U2 that started liking them when that album came out - appropriately enough they're called 'Achtung Babies' and it used to be almost dismissive because at one point, Achtung Baby was a fairly recent album and an Achtung Baby was a fan who only liked U2 because of their last album.</p>
<p>Now, 20 years on, I'm proud to say I'm an Achtung Baby. It's definitely one of the best albums of the last 20 years. It's one of the only albums I know backwards and forwards on guitar, from start to finish.</p>
<p>From the opening crash of landing in 'Zoo Station' to the lament of 'Love is Blindness', the whole album is a wonderful journey through a band's attempt to leap from one mountaintop experience to the next - including the valley in between.</p>
<p>For now, <a href="http://www.u2.com/news/title/preview-from-the-sky-down">view the trailer on U2.com</a>, but I'm sure it will find it's way onto Youtube/etc. after the documentary opens at the Toronto International Film Festival tonight.</p>
