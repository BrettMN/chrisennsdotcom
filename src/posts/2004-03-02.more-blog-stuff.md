<p>Looks like my little update has touched off a whole slew of updates in the local blogging world as <a href="http://duke.usask.ca/~wasylow/blog/">Phil</a> and <a href="http://bloglos.kicks-ass.net/">Carlos</a> (go grab the new Pilate album from Carlos' site btw) have done some reinventing of their blogs as well.</p>
<p>I found a slick little app called <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/itti.php">Kung-Tunes</a> that pulls the latest song listing from iTunes and throws them up into a file on my web server that I can pull into this page.  Whuapaa!</p>
<p>I'm still settling into this redesign so expect some changes over the next little while but I'm digging the font size so it's staying.  Get out your bi-focals or go <a href="http://www.paulmartintimes.ca/personal-paul/blogs_e.asp">someone else's blog</a>.</p>
