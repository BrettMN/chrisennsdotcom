<p>Speaking of redesigns of blogs (and vanity urls to boot), Matt Wiebe - <a href="http://ssktn.com/podcasts/welcometotheinternet/003-welcome-to-the-internet-matt-wiebe/">guest number two on a little internet podcast thing</a> - recently launched his own redesigned blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s all about the writing and not at all about anything else, like <a href="http://somadesign.ca/projects/the-erudite/">my WordPress theme</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>He seems to be missing the FaceSmashYourTwitter buttons to share the content, but I'm sure that's coming soon. (/sarcasm)</p>
