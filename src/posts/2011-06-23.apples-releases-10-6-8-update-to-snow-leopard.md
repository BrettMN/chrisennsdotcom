<p><b>After</b> you've done a Time Machine backup: Go to the Apple in the top left corner, click Software Update and click Install.</p>
<p>Possibly the last update before Lion comes out in July. And possibly the last time you update your OS this way - from now on it'll likely be through the Mac App Store.</p>
