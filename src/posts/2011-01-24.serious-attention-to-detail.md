<p>One for Apple nerds as well as attention to detail folks from Apple's handling of new email on iOS (iPhone/iPod touch):</p>
<blockquote><p>This is serious attention to detail. It’s not something people will show off to each other on the bus, or something that you can put on an advert or trumpet on a feature list. It just makes the app a bit quieter and a bit more well behaved. The addition of this extra detail has made the app less visible than if the detail wasn’t there. Lovely.</p></blockquote>
