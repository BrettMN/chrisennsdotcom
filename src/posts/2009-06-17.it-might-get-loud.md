<p>I really hope this will be in a local theatre.  <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony/itmightgetloud/">Trailer here</a> on Apple's trailer site.</p>
<p><strong>Update June 22</strong>: <a href="http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2009/06/22/it-might-get-loud/">The Lefsetz Letter</a> reviews It Might Get Loud.</p>
<blockquote><p>"It Might Get Loud" is a summit meeting between three legendary guitarists, Jack White, the Edge and the aforementioned Mr. Page.  They ultimately unite for a confab on a soundstage in Burbank, where they ruminate on where they’re coming from and eventually play a great take on "In My Time Of Dying" and a superfluous, weak "The Weight".  And in between, we go into each of the three’s roots.</p></blockquote>
