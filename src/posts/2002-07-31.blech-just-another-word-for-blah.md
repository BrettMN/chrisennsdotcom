<p>Not much to talk about here, so I decided to start making my website more my own instead of just one of the templates that comes with MovableType. You'll notice the spiffy new banner at the top... and that's about it. I have to get more gutsy and start fooling around with the stylesheet for the site - but I have yet to find said guts.</p>
<p>It looks like my parents have bought a shack up at Waskesiu and so we plan to spend some time there on our holidays next week. It's got everything we need, except running water. But there's a tap nearby as well as a washroom/shower. Should be fun. I'll bring back pictures.</p>
<p>Today's picture is in honor of my parent's purchase - in honor of them becoming land barons:</p>
