<p>The recording industry is not being hurt by pirated music as they would like you to believe.  <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news/posts/1080605291.html">Here's an excellent write-up</a> on the recent news that's come out that the Australian recording industry is hiding numbers showing that they've had their best year ever so that they can trumpet the anti-piracy claims.</p>
<p>And a <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1027_3-5181562.html">new study</a> by researchers at Harvard and N. Carolina states that <i>even high levels of file-swapping seemed to translate into an effect on album sales that was "statistically indistinguishable from zero."</i></p>
