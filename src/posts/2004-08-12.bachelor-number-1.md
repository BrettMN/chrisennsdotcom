<p>Sue's gone to the 'Peg to pick up her sisters and bro-in-law (also named Chris - the fun never stops at family get togethers) so I'll be partying it up this weekend, livin the single life again just like I used to before I got hitched up...  ya know, ball and chain like.</p>
<p>Which really means I'll be in bed by 10 on Friday after exhausting myself watching tv and trying to figure out whether a bag of smarties or a box of mini-wheats would make for a better meal.  Party on!  Woo!</p>
