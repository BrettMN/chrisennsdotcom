<p>The final season starts February 2nd.  If you're one of those people who's jumped on the "Lost got crappy when...[insert comment about writing, plot, storyline here]" then that's fine - you can have your <strike>wrong</strike> opinion - but I for one am excited to see how they end this ride.  It's easily one of the best drama/action shows on TV IMHO.</p>
