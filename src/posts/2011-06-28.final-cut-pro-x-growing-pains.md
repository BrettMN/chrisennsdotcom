quote-copy: 'So if you’re really a professional you shouldn’t want to be reliant on software from a company like Apple.  Because your heart will be broken.  Because they’re not reliant on you.  Use Apple’s tools to take you as far as they can – they’re an incredible bargain in terms of price-performance.  But once you’re ready to move up to the next level, find yourself a software provider whose life-blood flows only as long as they keep their professional customers happy.  It only makes sense.'

<p>Apple is famous for going after the solution that 90% of the market will want and not worrying about the 10% - in this case, video editing professionals. 150,000 people buying Final Cut Pro X at $299 is better than 20,000 buying Final Cut Pro 7 at $1,200.</p>
