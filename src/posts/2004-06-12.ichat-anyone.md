<p>I was just <a href="http://www.apple.com/ichat">ichattin</a> with Mark and am thinking I gotta use this more often.  It's just as convinient as the phone and with wireless internet it's like a cordless.  The problem is I have no real reason to use it - it's just a cool technology.  That's pretty much enough reason for me.  I'm seriously tempted by the horribly overpriced ($189?!?! C'mon Apple!) and more useless to me <a href="http://www.apple.com/isight">isight</a> webcamera just because of how well it works.  I know in the latest version of MSN M$ made some improvements on the video component, but it still doesn't work as well as iChat with an iSight.</p>
<p>I think we need to convince Sue's <a href="http://www.oatways.com/chrisandrin/">sis and bro-in-law</a> who live in Australia to get themselves a mac with an isight.  heh heh..  Friggin Apple.  It's like a cult.</p>
