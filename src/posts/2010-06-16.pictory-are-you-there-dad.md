<p>A great set of photos and stories <a href="http://www.pictorymag.com/showcases/are-you-there-dad/">on Pictory in honour of the upcoming day for father's</a>.</p>
<p>From the intro:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even if they insist that they have a close buddy for a father, there tends to be an underlying note of longing for something more.</p></blockquote>
<p>From one photo:</p>
<blockquote><p>He pointed to a storefront with broken glass and another damaged building. Then he got down to my level, cupped my face in his hands, looked me in the eyes, and said “This is what happens when people hate, don’t you ever forget this.” I never have. </p></blockquote>
<p>What a heavy word "dad" is.  Becoming a father 3 years ago and then again 3 months ago certainly changes your world and how you view your relationship with your own dad.  More on that some other time, perhaps.</p>
