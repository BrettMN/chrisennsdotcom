<p>I think I'll stop posting Jobs related stuff now and leave it with John Gruber's post, entitled <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/10/universe_dented_grass_underfoot">Universe Dented, Grass Underfoot</a>, about his experience at WWDC and Steve Jobs' final Apple keynote event:</p>
<blockquote><p>Late last night, long hours after the news broke that he was gone, my thoughts returned to those grass stains on his shoes back in June. I realize only now why they caught my eye. Those grass stained sneakers were the product of limited time, well spent. And so the story Iâ€™ve told myself is this:</p>
<p>I like to think that in the run-up to his final keynote, Steve made time for a long, peaceful walk. Somewhere beautiful, where there are no footpaths and the grass grows thick. Hand-in-hand with his wife and family, the sun warm on their backs, smiles on their faces, love in their hearts, at peace with their fate.</p></blockquote>
