<p>No, not actual flights provided by Google. Rather their search utility for finding flights is <a href="http://www.google.ca/flights">now available for Canadian cities</a>.</p>

<p>I prefer the look and feel of <a href="http://www.hipmunk.com/">Hipmunk</a> but it can't hurt to have the king of search trying to find good flights.</p>
