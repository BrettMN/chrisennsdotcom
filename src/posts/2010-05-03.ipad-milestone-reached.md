<p>Apple announced <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/05/03ipad.html">that they've sold 1 million iPads</a>.  Not bad.</p>
<blockquote><p>“One million iPads in 28 days—that’s less than half of the 74 days it took to achieve this milestone with iPhone,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow.</p>
