<p>With the announcment of <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">Airport Express</a> and the iTunes Music Store Canada <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2004/06/20040606164657.shtml">expected on June 15th</a> it's shaping up to be a good Apple month.</p>
<p>The Apple <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">World Wide Developer Conference</a> is also up at the end of the month, where new Powermac G5's and possibly an iMac G5 are expected.  Both are out of my price range and out of my "need" range, but it's still cool to drool.</p>
