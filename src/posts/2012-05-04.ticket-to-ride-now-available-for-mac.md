<p>Ticket to Ride is <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fticket-to-ride%252Fid470834073%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30">now available for the Mac for $9.99 on the Mac App Store</a>. With the ability to play against Mac, PC, Linux and iPad users, it's a pretty great way to get your railroad gaming fix.</p>
<p>Except if you're colour blind. I find the iPhone version basically unplayable at times because I can't tell the difference between different train cars. I wish more developers would add the ability to choose your own colours when playing on devices like the iPhone. It shouldn't matter what colour I choose on my device - the software should be able to figure out which trains belong to who.</p>
