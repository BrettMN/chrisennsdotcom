<p>Apple has released an update to <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fgarageband%252Fid408709785%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">GarageBand for iOS</a> that now enables it to run on iPhones and iPod touch devices.</p>
<p>I've played with it on the iPad and it's a lot of fun and very intuitive to use. The iPhone screen seems a bit small to be able to play around with it like that but you can't beat the portability of having a multi-track recorder in your pocket.</p>
