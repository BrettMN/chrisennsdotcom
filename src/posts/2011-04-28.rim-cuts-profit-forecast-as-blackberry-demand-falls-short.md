<p>They blame "intense competition from Apple and Google," but how can it be anything but lack of innovation and inability to be anything but a one hit wonder?</p>
<p>I really want RIM to succeed, both as a Canadian company but also due to the fact that Apple does it's best work when it's being pushed by competition - but RIM is falling very quickly.</p>
