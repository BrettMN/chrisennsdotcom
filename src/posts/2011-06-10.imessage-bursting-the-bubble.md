<p>More on how iMessage in iOS5 will hurt the cellular carriers including an angle I hadn't thought much about - international texting.</p>
<p>iMessage will replace the existing Messages app and by default will attempt to use iMessage first when sending a SMS style message and only if the other person isn't on a iOS based device will it use SMS as a backup sending method.</p>
<p>Helps create lock-in to Apple's iOS devices and cuts out the carriers from SMS charges. But I'd sooner be locked (and I use that term loosely) into Apple than a cellular carrier. Apple has routinely demonstrated that they have their users interest very close to their heart. </p>
<p>Cellular carriers? I'm pretty sure they'd gut your heart out and try and charge you a service fee for putting it back in before you drop dead.</p>
