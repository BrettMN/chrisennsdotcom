<p>I finally got it working.  It came down to some permissions.  I may have opened myself up to attacks from the hax0r world but I don't care - <a href="http://chrisenns.isa-geek.com">I got a blogger blog working!</a></p>
<p>Once I get PHP and Perl working I can get Movabletype going and start serving up some blogs and dump dixiesys where mennoboy currently is hosted.  20GB of storage sounds a lot better than 200MB, doncha think?</p>
