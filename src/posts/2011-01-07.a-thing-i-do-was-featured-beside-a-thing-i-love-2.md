<p>A show called <a href="http://ssktn.com/shows/welcome-to-the-internet/">Welcome to the Internet</a> on the podcast thing I'm doing in my spare time, <a href="http://www.ssktn.com">SSKTN</a> was <a href="http://ssktn.com/ssktnnews/welcome-to-the-internet-featured-in-itunes/">listed in a couple of iTunes podcast categories</a>.</p>
<p>MIght not seem like a huge deal, but as I post this it's 9:15 a.m. and downloads of the various episodes have surpassed the busiest day ever on SSKTN.</p>
