<p>Just in case you're wondering why all these old entries are showing up - thanks to the <a href="http://web.archive.org">internet archive</a> I can go and grab a bunch of my old entries.  It's actually a neat way to remember what you're site once looked like if you're into frequent redesigns like I am.</p>
<p>Since I'm nerdy about being complete I'll be trying to grab as much of my old entries as possible.  I didn't realize I had started this version of the blog back in May of 2002.  Coming up on 2 years now.  That's a lot of blabbing.</p>
