<p>I've been loaned a Nintendo Wii by my brother-in-law while they're gone for 6 months. The games they have are:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.minivanmegafun.ca/wp35/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Wii-Games-We-Borrowed.jpg"><img src="http://www.minivanmegafun.ca/wp35/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Wii-Games-We-Borrowed-620x463.jpg" alt="Wii Games We Borrowed" width="620" height="463" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-438" /></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super Mario Brothers Wii</li>
<li>Lego Batman 2</li>
<li>Lego Pirates of the Caribbean</li>
<li>Batman The Brave and the Bold</li>
<li>Super Mario Galaxy</li>
<li>Skylanders (I seriously need this one explained to me!)</li>
<li>Donkey Kong Country Returns (Not pictured above)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I'm listing these games to show that I already have them to play. I'm looking for <strong>other</strong> ideas of what to play.</em></p>
<p>We've never really played any Wii games. We have an Xbox 360 so we've played any games that are available on both platforms (i.e. Lego Star Wars, etc.)</p>
<p>Up until the Wii I was a huge Nintendo fan and owned the original NES and played a bunch of games on the Super NES.</p>
<h3>This is Where You Come In</h3>
<p>So my question to you, faithful and knowledge readers of my blog, what games should we play in our short window with a Wii?</p>
