<p>If the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5875571/google-just-made-bing-the-best-search-engine">nerds are starting to switch from Google to Bing</a>, you know things are getting bad:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Google changed the way search works this week. It deeply integrated Google+ into search results. It's ostensibly meant to deliver more personalized results. But it pulls those personalized results largely from Google servicesâ€”Google+, Picasa, YouTube. Search for a restaurant, and instead of its Yelp page, the top result might be someone you know discussing it on Google Plus.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Can't say I'm all that concerned yet. But it is interesting to see Google getting thrown into the same corner as Microsoft used to be a few years ago - the big, bad monster that's out to get you and every company.</p>
