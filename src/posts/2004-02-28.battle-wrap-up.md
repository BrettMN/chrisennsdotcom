<p><b>Update:</b> The other bands didn't suck quite enough.  We lost out to Postlude and Unknown Reason.  Considering we had the marketability of a wet rock, I'm not too surprised.  ;)</p>
<p>We came, we saw, we left early cuz the other bands sucked. <a href="http://www.mennoboy.com/chris/images/battle/battle.html">More Pics Here</a></p>
<p>Well, that's not totally true.  We only stayed for the next two bands and then split.  It was a fun first time out for this crew as a whole and hope to play again.  In a way not having a soundcheck and plugging in to an amp I'd never seen before tonight was a bit refreshing and we knew, aside from how we played, we had very little control over what we ended up sounding like.</p>

<p>Now begins our 'eastern mysticism period' where we experiment with drugs and use lots of sitars.</p>
