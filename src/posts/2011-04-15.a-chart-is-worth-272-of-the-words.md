<p>iPad and Mac OS sales are doing alright:</p>
<blockquote><p>The bottom line is that Windows-only computer units are down 2.0% while OSX-based computer units are up 272% (this excludes both the iPhone and iPod touch).</p></blockquote>
<p>Check out<a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/04/14/first-quarter-pc-forecast-windows-down-2-macipad-up-250/"> the chart on asymco.com</a>. There's a reason a lot of Windows stats don't include iPads as a computer in their reports.</p>
