<p>The Verge has a great video review up of the iPhone X, including a great way to see the tech behind the Face ID sensors:</p>

<p>Overall they love the iPhone X but it's still running iOS with it's quirks. It makes me wonder if we'll ever see a dramatic change to iOS the way macOS changed from OS 9 to OS X. Phone hardware development happens even faster and at a larger scale than computer development did which must make it difficult to try and push major software changes when the hardware is what makes you money.</p>
<p>For me, I'm happy with the iPhone 8 I upgraded to this year. Baring any hardware issues (defects or accidents), I'm sure it'll last me 2-3 years just like my iPhone 6 did before it. I'm also fine with letting early adopters work out the kinks of facial recognition before using it on my iPhone.</p>
