<p>Quote from Ken Segall, former creative director at TBWA\Chiat\Day, Apple's ad agency who worked on the <em>Think Different</em> ads as well as came up with the name 'iMac':</p>
<blockquote><p>“Dell and Apple: It’s night and day,” Segall says. “It’s a transactional world Dell lives in. It’s all about numbers. Everything they say about Apple making products for themselves is true. Apple — it’s about changing the world. For everyone else, it’s about the money.”</p></blockquote>
<p>For those of you who only know Apple as the successful company where everything it touches turns to piles of money, <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/20172/20172">this is a good read</a> on how Apple averted bankruptcy.</p>
