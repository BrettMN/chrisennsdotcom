<blockquote><p>"I appreciate you had your fun with our phone and I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at the sales guy who lost it. But we need the phone back because we can't let it fall into the wrong hands."</p>
<p>I thought, maybe its already in the wrong hands?</p>
<p>He continued, "There are two ways we can do this. I can send someone to pick up the phone–"</p>
<p>Me: "I don't have it"</p>
<p>"–But you know someone who does…or we can send someone with legal papers, and I don't want to do that."</p>
<p>He was giving us an easy way out.</p>
<p>I told him I had to talk to my dudes. Before he hung up, he asked me, "What do you think of it?"</p>
<p>I said, "It's beautiful."
