<p>.. for only $150,000US.</p>
<p>This site lists all of Clear Channel Entertainment's pricing for college's who want to hire various entertainers and musicians for an event. So, if you're wanting to book a really special birthday party for someone, get out the old cheque-book and drum up some coporate sponsors and away you go!</p>
<p>Sadly, U2 isn't listed - I guess there really are some things money can't buy. :)</p>
