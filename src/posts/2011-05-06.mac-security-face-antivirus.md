<p>It's not really a virus - more malware. Something that's designed to trick you into getting your credit card information.</p>
<p>Any computer system is only as secure as the person using it. If you're willing to put your admin password in (required before you can install/run something like this) then there's not much that can be done.</p>
<p><b>Bottom line</b>: Don't ever install programs from a company or website you don't trust.</p>
<p><b>Second bottom line</b>: <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2011/04/06/backup/" title="" target="">BACKUP!</a></p>
