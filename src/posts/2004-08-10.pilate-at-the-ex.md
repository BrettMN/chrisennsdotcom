<p>Went to see Pilate tonight.  (<a href="http://chrisenns.isa-geek.com/gallery/Friends">Pics here</a>)  Pretty good show.  I can imagine they'd be a lot better in a club/indoor venue so I'll try and catch them in the fall when they come back.  <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/nothedge/Movies/iMovieTheater42.html">Check out a video clip here</a>.</p>
