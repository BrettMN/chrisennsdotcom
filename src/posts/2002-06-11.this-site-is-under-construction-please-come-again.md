<p>So I did some stuff to the site that might make it a little slower in some areas, but should make for more space on the server for more important things - like my email. (doh!)</p>
<p>I off-loaded all the pictures from our travels and music/movies to my Shaw homepage so they may take a little longer to load now, but at least I'll be able to recieve my email at work and not worry about running out of space.</p>
<p>Other than that, I also added a 'Sign Up To Be Notified' box on the right hand side where you can pop your email address in to be notified whenever an update is done to this site. I promise to sell your email address to as many people as possible and use it to sign up for as much spam as possible.</p>
<p>At least I'm being honest right? You appreciate honesty don't you? I thought so.</p>
