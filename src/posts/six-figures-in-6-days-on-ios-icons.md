A crazy story of Apple simply allowing power users to change icons for apps on iOS [made a designer over $100k in a week](https://tr.af/6):

> The next thing I knew, I was making $28 what felt like every 28 seconds. My phone turned into the ultimate dopamine dispenser (if it wasn't already).

All from a [single tweet](https://twitter.com/traf/status/1307707156788060160) that caught fire.

If you just read the headline and first couple of paragraphs and leave, you'd miss the most important part of his "quick" success:

> In the same way that creating icon sets 7 years ago prepared me for last week, this whole experiment has likely prepared me for what's to come years from now.

Overnight success is rarely that. It's often years spent trying to figure out a path and direction, perfecting a craft.
