<p>Just as I was about to hit publish on my previous post about leaving my job, I saw on Twitter people starting to post about Steve Jobs <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Steve-Jobs-Resigns-as-CEO-of-bw-19285464.html">resigning from Apple</a>. Not that there's any similarity to me and him in terms of accomplishments, etc. Just was a bit freaky to have happen at the same time.</p>
<p>It's sad news because it's likely due to health issues getting too bad to be able to carry on. Definitely thinking of him and his family at this time.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mrgan/status/106497844466298882">@mrgan said on Twitter</a>,</p>

I just did it for 5 seconds and I hate everyone." title="Screen Shot 2011-08-24 at 4.56.11 PM" width="599" height="379" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19640" /></p>
