<p>Hoping to raise somewhere between $5 and $10 billion on a public IPO, Facebook is about to change.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  From here on out, Facebook will be judged by its share price, market cap, P/E ratio and a whole host of other Wall Street jargon. Pay no attention to Zuckerbeg's assertion that the company won't be beholden to quarterly reports: they will (just ask Jeff Bezos, who made a similar promise when Amazon went public).
</p></blockquote>
<p>When a third of your employees could become millionaires on the day shares trade, it'll be interesting to see who decides to leave and who sticks around. There's a lot of interesting things to do once you have a million dollars - more interesting than sitting in a cubicle making widgets for a billionaire.</p>
