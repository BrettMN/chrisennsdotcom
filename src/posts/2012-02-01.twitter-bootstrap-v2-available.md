<p><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/?v=2.0">Bootstrap</a> is a great base or starting point for web developers with support for cross browsers (Internet Explorer 7 &amp; up, tablets, smartphones), grid based for easier layout, and a responsive design that adapts to the various devices it's on (<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/?v=2.0">view the page itself and resize your browser window to get an idea of what that looks like</a>).</p>

<p>It's a great template to use for quick one pager sites that don't require a lot of content to be changed later (<em>i.e. <a href="http://www.groveyouth.com/">groveyouth.com/</a> which isn't actually built with Bootstrap, but only because it wasn't out when I was building that landing page</em>) or for a really high traffic site where you don't want a heavy, slow CMS making people wait for it to render out the content.</p>
