<blockquote><p>
  Notably, since the event happened in Berlin, those finals took place at an absurdly early hour of the day for those watching in North America. That didn't stop 36 million total unique viewers from tuning in around the world, a number that Riot calls "a record-breaking high for any esports event." It also represents an increase of nearly 10 million unique viewers from League of Legends' 2014 World Championship.
