<p>We went up to my parent's shack at Waskesiu this weekend - (<a href="http://chrisenns.isa-geek.com/gallery/Waskesiu">pics available here if you're interested</a>) and now we're getting ready to leave for North Carolina.  It's supposed to be 25 - 35 degrees down there this week so we'll hopefully get at least one full week of summer this year.</p>
