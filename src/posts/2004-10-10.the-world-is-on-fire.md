<p>Hearts are worn<br />
In these dark ages<br />
You're not alone,<br />
In these stories' pages<br />
The light has fallen<br />
Amongst the living and the dying<br />
And I'll try to hold it in<br />
Yeah I'll try to hold it in</p>
<p>The world is on fire<br />
It's more than I can handle<br />
I'll tap into the water<br />
Try and bring my share<br />
Try to bring more, more than I can handle<br />
Bring it to the table<br />
Bring what I am able ...</p>
<p>I watch the heavens<br />
But I find no calling<br />
Something I can do to change what's coming<br />
Stay close to me<br />
While the sky is falling<br />
I don't wanna be left alone,<br />
Don't want to be alone...</p>
<p>The world is on fire<br />
It's more than I can handle<br />
I'll tap into the water<br />
Try and bring my share<br />
Try to bring more, more than I can handle<br />
Bring it to the table<br />
Bring what I am able ...</p>
<p>Hearts break ... hearts mend ... love still hurts<br />
visions clash ... planes crash<br />
Still there's talk of saving souls<br />
Still the cold is closing in on us</p>
<p>We part the veil on our killer sun<br />
Stray from the straight line<br />
On this short run ...<br />
The more we take the less we become<br />
The fortune of one man means less for some</p>
<p>The world is on fire<br />
It's more than I can handle<br />
I'll tap into the water<br />
Try and bring my share<br />
Try to bring more, more than I can handle<br />
Bring it to the table<br />
Bring what I am able ...</p>
<p>The world is on fire<br />
It's more than I can handle<br />
I'll tap into the water<br />
Try and bring my share<br />
Try to bring more, more than I can handle<br />
Bring it to the table<br />
Bring what I am able ..<br />
- Sarah McLachlan - 'World on Fire'</p>
