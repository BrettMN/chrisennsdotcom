<p>We're off to Waskesiu (is that how it's spelled?) this weekend - well part of it anyways. Hopefully the storm that's brewing doesn't get too nasty and we can have a good time out there with my family. We're all packing in to one cabin so it should be fun.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan air got sold on ebay - I think I know what business I'm starting next.</p>
<p>Get a free game compliments of the U.S. Army.</p>
<p>That's it for me - have a great weekend!</p>
