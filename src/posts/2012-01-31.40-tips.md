<p>40 Tips in 40 Minutes was the name of a talk given by <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/">David Sparks</a>, <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/">Merlin Mann</a> and <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a> at MacWorld | iWorld 2012. <a href="http://40tips.com/">40tips.com</a> is the follow up website with all the tips they mentioned - currently some of the tips anyways.</p>
<p>One that was new to me of the list there so far is the ability to <a href="http://40tips.com/cmd-opt-click-dock-icon-to-focus-an-app/">CMD-OPTION CLICK on a Dock icon</a> to focus on just that app.</p>
<p>Handy.</p>
