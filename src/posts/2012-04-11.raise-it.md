<blockquote><p>
  It's not our job to appeal to the lowest common denominator. It's our job to raise it.

<p>Apparently a quote from the television show The West Wing, found from a retweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/hjnaidu">Hemant Naidu on Twitter</a>. Have to process it a bit but it certainly is an interesting quote to use when developing and designing things for the web.</p>
