<p>misc. stuff from the web: if you've got $25kUS to throw around, you might want to bid on a futuristic car based on a Woody Allen movie ... if that doesn't tickle your fancy, you can learn how to play chess from Screech off of Saved By The Bell ... finally, check out the ongoing tennis matchup (and photoshop contest) between phil and carlos ... see if you can pick out which pics i did and which one phil did :)</p>
