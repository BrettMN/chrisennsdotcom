<p>I think it's time to pull out my old Sega Genesis... if I still have it some where... and play some Altered Beast, albeit with an <a href="http://www.epicgaming.net/hardware/md_oc">overclocked processor</a> .  I don't know what you could gain by overclocking your game system where the games are already tuned to run fine on it - but I guess it's not a question of why, more a question of why not?</p>
