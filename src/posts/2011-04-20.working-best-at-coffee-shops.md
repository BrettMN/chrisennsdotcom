quote-copy: 'There''s that scene in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid when the latter is asked to demonstrate his shooting prowess, but can''t hit the target unless he''s moving. On some level, I think the same thing is going on when I write. Forced to focus on a single thing the mind rebels, whereas adding another element somehow focuses it. The coffeehouse somehow provides that element.'
