<p>If you're a certain friend of mine who recently bought a Mac you may want to avoid reading this for fear that your wife is going to go into a fit of Mennonite-Missing-Out-On-a-Deal-Ytis (<em>MOODY for short</em>).  That or make plans to call the Apple store (1-800-676-2775 / <a href="http://store.apple.com/ca/help/returns_refund?mco=OTY2Nzk2Mw">refund web page</a>) and get the price difference or threaten to return said computer.</p>
<p>For anyone who's been looking at buying a Mac, today might be a good day to do so.  Since it's turkey weekend in America, they're passing on savings to everyone else today only - <a href="http://store.apple.com/ca/browse/campaigns/holiday/giftguide/black_friday">Black Friday gift guide from Apple</a>.  You can save around $100 on laptops or iMacs and $48 on iPod touches.  Most everything else is $5 - $10 savings, so nothing huge.</p>
<p>If you're a student or connected to someone who is, don't lose any sleep over these prices as they're only $1 cheaper than what Apple sells them for on the education side.</p>
