<p>He picked up a 64GB white iPhone 4S.</p>
<p>Faster, less signal loss, better speaker phone abilities, gentler vibration for notifications, and a better camera:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the iPhone 4 camera was good enough that you <em>could</em> leave your point and shoot at home. Then the iPhone 4S camera is good enough that you <em>should</em> leave your point and shoot at home.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the record, I won't be upgrading my iPhone 4 to a 4S. I'd love to be able to for the camera upgrade alone, but it's just not worth it considering how much I'd have to pay since I'm not eligible for a hardware upgrade with Telus.</p>
