<p>I think it was the first game I bought for my iPod touch back when the app store launched: <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fdeep-green-chess%252Fid299471086%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Deep Green Chess</a> (<em>affiliate link</em>) is a great chess game and now supports native iPad and Retina display resolutions.</p>
<p>One advantage to buying it way back when I did - the price is now $7.99 and I'm almost positive I didn't pay that much for it when I bought it. Free updates to original purchasers, even back from 2008. <a href="http://cocoastuff.com/blog/2011/04/deep-green-12/">From the blog post announcing the update:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Even if you bought it more than two years ago, youâ€™ll be able to run it on any of your current iOS devices. And at no point in time have you had a reason to regret buying Deep Green at a higher price, because it has stayed the same since after the short introductory period. If anything, price will increase as more features are added over time.</p></blockquote>
