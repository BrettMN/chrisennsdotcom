<p>System Failure</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Our system of law doesn't acknowledge the derivative nature of creativity. Instead, ideas are regarded as property, as unique and original lots with distinct boundaries. But ideas aren't so tidy. They're layered, theyâ€™re interwoven, they're tangled. And when the system conflicts with the reality... the system starts to fail.
