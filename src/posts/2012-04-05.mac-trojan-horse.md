<p>Apparently <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1166227/analyst_600_000_macs_infected_with_trojan_horse.html">600,000 Macs are infected with a Trojan horse</a> that got they would've gotten by visiting a bogus website.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The infected websites listed by the company are mainly in the .nu domain (assigned to the island state of Niue), ranging from URLs related to movies and TV streaming services to a domain called Gangstasparadise.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm sure a lot of readers of chrisenns.com were frequent visitors of Gangstasparadise, so if you're feeling nerdy and you can check if your Mac is infected by <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/trojan-downloader_osx_flashback_i.shtml">following these steps</a>.</p>
<p>Or just run Software Update (Click the Apple in the top left corner, select 'Software Update') to get the patch from Apple.</p>
