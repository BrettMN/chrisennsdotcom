quote-copy: 'No professional should ever deal with a Request For Proposal. RFPs are appropriate for commodity goods and services only. Design professionals do not deal in commodity services, but rather professional services. Such things require more than a mere outline of requirements as the basis of an agreement to enter into a relationship.'

<p>From Andy's new online/ebook entitled Design Professionalism. Plenty to digest.</p>
<p>I wish there was a paperback version instead of just Ebook/online because I know if I buy an Ebook version it will just sit on my hard drive/iPad and never actually get read.</p>
