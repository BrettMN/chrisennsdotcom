<p>It's taken a little longer than I thought - but we finally got (just about) everything moved to the new site.</p>
<p>If you're looking for Matthew Harm's site, he'll be up soon as well.  And once we decide on a name, we should be going with a menno(insert appropriate female version).com.  Apparently someone decided to buy mennogirl.com.</p>
