<p>Think <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> is just some useless toy for the kids who like sharing the fact that they're going to bathroom right now?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSWBT01137420090616">US State Department asked Twitter not go offline for scheduled maintenance</a> so that people could continue to communicate in Iran during the election protests.</p>
<p>I guess this could also be a new form of propaganda and control the US gov't is trying to exert, but at least they don't have control over the actual information being spread.</p>
