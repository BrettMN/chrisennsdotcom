<p>Easy to recommend to fans of U2 â€” and you've probably already watched it if you are - but <a href="http://www.rte.ie/player/us/show/the-works-presents-3056/10681135/">there's a fantastic interview with Adam Clayton of U2 on the Irish television program The Works</a> that covers the band's influences, art, and staying relevant at 40 years as a band.</p>
