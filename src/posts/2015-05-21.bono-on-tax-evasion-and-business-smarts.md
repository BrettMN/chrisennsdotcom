<blockquote><p>Bono also addressed criticism that the move contradicts his history of charity work. He insisted: "Because you're good at philanthropy and because I am an activist people think you should be stupid in business and I don't run with that." The Edge added, "So much of our business is outside of Ireland so it is ridiculous to make a big deal out of it."</p></blockquote>
