Last night the SaskParty published a video with our Premier Scott Moe talking about how it's time to have a conversation about ending government COVID restrictions - something they've been hinting at wanting to do for the past few weeks. They're being pushed into the conversation by [truckers and friends who are protesting in Ottawa](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60202050).

What I find interesting and disheartening in all of this is how our Premier has adopted the language of the protesters, who in turn adopted it from similar minded groups in the USA - the key word being "freedom".

The truck protesters are on a "freedom convey" to eliminate COVID19 related mandates. And now our Premier is using that same focus to get rid of what little restrictions we have left in Saskatchewan.

In his address, posted in [two](https://twitter.com/premierscottmoe/status/1489045180745494529?s=21) [parts](https://twitter.com/premierscottmoe/status/1489045258553995265?s=21) on Twitter, Premier Moe rambles through his reasoning for ending restrictions like your patronizing, mansplaining uncle. He ends the whole thing with this final paragraph:

> Travel, go to work, have dinner with your friends, go to the movies, go to your kids games - most important. You should do all of these things without constantly assessing if your every activity is absolutely necessary. What's necessary is your freedom. What's necessary is getting your life back to normal. And it's time. I want to thank all of you for the sacrifices

A few questions about how Premier Moe chose to end this very important address to Saskatchewan:

"*...go to your kids games - most important.*"

He is **very** concerned about kids sports - especially minor hockey. Which has continued throughout most of the pandemic with a few stops during especially bad waves of COVID19.

"*You should do all of these things without constantly assessing if your every activity is absolutely necessary.*"

All around me here in Saskatoon I see the majority of people living their lives like normal. The way he talks is as if cities and small towns are ghost towns with everyone afraid to leave their house. I really doubt the "good people of Saskatchewan" that he's hearing from complaining about the limited restrictions we still have are actually living that much differently than before COVID19 - besides having to show a proof of vaccination at a restaurant.

"*What's necessary is your freedom.*" 

Why is *my freedom* the most necessary thing in life? In Canada we already have a [list of our rights and freedoms](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/learn-about-canada/human-rights/your-rights-freedoms.html), none of which are being stopped by COVID restrictions.

This sentence is the most selfish thing our government has uttered this entire pandemic. The idea that **my** freedom is the most important thing above all else. It flies in the face of one of the ideas I've constantly heard about Saskatchewan my entire life here: that we're a people of volunteers who step up to help when help is needed. We're in this together.

The Saskparty has constantly tried to use the refrain of "the good people of Saskatchewan" to remind us of how
