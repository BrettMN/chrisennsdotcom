<p>I love Apple's response to <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-03-28/apple-offers-ipad-refunds/3917440">this issue</a> - sure, go ahead and return your new iPad.</p>
<p>I sympathize with people who don't understand all the confusing marketing around cellular data connection speeds and technologies. And Apple clearly shouldn't be marketing their device as 4G in a country where it's not actually compatible with their 4G network.</p>
<p>But I'm guessing the amount of people who return their new iPads for their money back will be pretty low. More likely they'll exchange them for a non-4G version since it's useless to have that connectivity.</p>
