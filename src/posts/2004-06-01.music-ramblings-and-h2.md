<p>I'm sure some of you vaguely remember me prattling on <a href="http://www.mennoboy.com/chris/archives/000083.html">way</a> back <a href="http://www.mennoboy.com/chris/archives/000082.html">when</a> about some band called Pilate that Carlos introduced me to and now that they're getting play on radio and Much you probably hate them because there's some magical rule about a band being played on radio and TV that forces you to hate them even if they write a good tune.  Which is too bad because you'll miss out on a <a HREF="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000CO14V/farawsoclos0a-20">great record</a>.</p>
<p>After just finishing <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446532231/farawsoclos0a-20">Dude, Where's My Country</a> I'm wondering if Mr. Moore isn't behind <a href="http://www.fuh2.com/">this site.</a></p>
