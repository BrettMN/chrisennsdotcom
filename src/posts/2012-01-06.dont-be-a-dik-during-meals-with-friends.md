<p>Via <a href="http://coudal.com/archives/2012/01/dont_be_a_dik_d.php">coudal.com</a> comes this <a href="http://blkgirlblogging.tumblr.com/post/15301683144/str8nochaser-the-terrific-kid-onehoney">great game</a> for meals with your friends who can't stop checking their phone to see if a text message has come in:</p>
<h3>The Rules</h3>
<ol>
<li>The game starts after everyone has ordered.</li>
<li>Everybody places their phone on the table face down.</li>
<li>The first person to flip over their phone loses the game.</li>
<li>Loser of the game pays for the bill.</li>
<li>If the bill comes before anyone has flipped over their phone everybody is declared a winner and pays for their own meal.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm thinking of certain folks who I'm going to be seeing more of just so that I can get a free meal out of them.</p>
