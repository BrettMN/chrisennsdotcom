I was chatting with my wife, Sue, about having a tweet I'd posted misunderstood and criticized, and I couldn't articulate why the criticizm felt off. (*To be clear: I apolgized for the tweet and have since deleted it. It wasn't kind of me to write the words I did, even if they were general enough that you would've had to have very inside knowledge of things related to what I wrote.*)

Something about the situation reminded Sue of a quote she remembered from Brené Brown that I went and looked up to find out more context around, and it rings very true to how I view what I create online.

The quote is from [Brown's 2013 talk for 99U entitled "Why Your Critics Aren't The Ones Who Count"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-JXOnFOXQk&t=0s) - and is very likely in one of her books as well I'm sure. I've queued up the video below to the right point, approx. 6:22m into the talk.

Or [follow this link to watch it on YouTube starting at 6:22](https://youtu.be/8-JXOnFOXQk?t=380).

This is the actual phrase Brown is quoting from the Theordore Roosevelt speech, [The Main in the Arena](https://www.theodorerooseveltcenter.org/Learn-About-TR/TR-Encyclopedia/Culture-and-Society/Man-in-the-Arena.aspx):

> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,

Here's my paraphrase of her takeaways:

1) It's not about winning. It's not about losing. It's about showing up and being seen.
2) I want to create and make things. I want to show up and be seen in my work and my life. There is only one guarantee: you will get your ass kicked.
3) If you're not also in the arena also getting your ass kicked, I'm not interested in your feedback. If you're in the cheap seats, not putting yourself on the line, and just talking about how I could do it better, I am in no way interested in your feedback.

She added some caveats around enjoying the back and forth of constructive criticims that are working towards creating something better out of the work, that's fine. She's all for that. I know I struggle with this at times because eventually the work has to be done. Ship it. 

But the bottom line, for me, remains: if you're not also putting yourself out there. If you don't care to create, or express joy and love for things in the arena (be it blogging like this, writing tweets, creating a video for YouTube or TikTok, live streaming a podcast recording), I don't have time for your feedback on what I'm doing.
