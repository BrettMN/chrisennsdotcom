<p>Reports of me leaving work have been greatly exaggerated.  I think it's just that time off always seems to do my head in.  Does everyone feel like they should be doing something else if they've been away from their job for a week or two?</p>
<p>It's a short week as I'm off again next week - this time we're headed down to North Carolina.  Anyone got any good 'to-do's' down in the south besides hitting up Dolly World?</p>
