<p>Well my initial experience has been pretty good with allofmp3.com.  I plopped $10US (approx $15Cdn) into Paypal and got 1GB of downloads from them.  Being a bit nervous about how long it might actually last, I'm quickly burning through that 1GB.  I've downloaded 5 complete albums (Nelly Furtado, Johnny Cash, Dido, Norah Jones, Daniel Lanois) as well as a bunch of other single tunes (call them guilty pleasures, *cough* Timberlake *cough*, stuff I wouldn't want to be caught buying at Future Shop - ).</p>
<p>The more I read about them, they seem to be on the up and up.  I found a <a href="http://www.museekster.com/allofmp3info.htm">review of allofmp3.com</a> that explains a bit. They also link to a bunch of artists that <a href="http://www.museekster.com/allofmp3free.htm">have free downloads on allofmp3.com.</a>  Use your discretion.  It boils down to laws being different in Russia (duh) as well as the US dollar to Russian ruble conversion being in our favor in a big way.</p>
<p>It's no where near as easy as what iTunes music store would/will be - if <a href="http://www.apple.com">they</a> ever get around to releasing it up north here.</p>
