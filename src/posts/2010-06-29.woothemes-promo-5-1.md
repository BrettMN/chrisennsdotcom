<p>If you're running a WordPress site and hankering for a new theme, WooThemes is offering a <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=359&i=l0">5 for 1 promotion until midnight, June 30th 2010</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=359&amp;i=l0"><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/woothemes-300x187.png" alt="Click to view WooThemes" title="WooThemes" width="300" height="187" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2295" /></a></p>
<p>They do a great job of designing themes as well as having a great admin menu system, parts of which have since been adopted into WordPress v3.0.  You certainly can't go wrong with getting 5 themes for the price of one ($70).</p>
