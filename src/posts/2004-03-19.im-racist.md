<p>Walking through the tunnel with two coffees in my hand a East Indian girl from one of the tables setup there came up to me and asked me "Are you against racism?"</p>
<p>I naturally responded:</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Ooops.  I was thinking she was going to offer me a chance to sign up for the National Day To Support Hamster Rights or something.  So "No" just popped out of my mouth before I thought anything else.  Heh heh.  So now I'm a racist on campus.</p>
