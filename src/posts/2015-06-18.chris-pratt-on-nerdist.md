<p><a href="http://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-chris-pratt-and-colin-trevorrow/">Really interesting interview with Chris Pratt on the Nerdist</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Chris Pratt (Parks and Rec, Guardians of the Galaxy, Jurassic World) and Colin Trevorrow (Safety Not Guaranteed, Jurassic World) talk with Chris and Matt about what they think of Back to the Future 2, how life has changed for Chris since losing weight, and how social media changes the way actors are perceived.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you follow <a href="http://tumblr.chrisenns.com">my tumblr</a> you'll know I'm a big Chris Pratt fan. There's a great story about how the movie studio basically required them to have Chris Pratt's character say something in the trailer that he doesn't say in the movie.</p>
