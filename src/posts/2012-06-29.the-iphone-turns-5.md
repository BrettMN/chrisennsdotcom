<p>A <a href="http://www.techhive.com/article/2000186/iphone-turns-5-today.html">look back from techhive.com</a> including a link to <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1167465/iphone_five_years_in_our_pockets.html">this article from Macworld chief Jason Snell</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I had to laugh at one feature omission I complained about five years ago: “It would be nice if Safari allowed users to upload certain kinds of content in order to, for example, post pictures taken with the iPhone’s built-in camera to the Flickr photo-sharing site.” Five years later, that feature is slated to be part of the iOS 6 update this fall. See? Sometimes patience is rewarded.

<p>Up until this year, I hadn't realized that the iPhone and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lemon/7430100042">my son</a> are the same age.<sup id="fnref-20530:1"><a href="#fn-20530:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I didn't get an iPhone until the iPhone 4 came out but looking at my iPhoto and/or Flickr library, 90% of the photos since then are from an iPhone.</p>

A few days apart technically. And if it isn't obvious, I'm much more interested in celebrating his birthday, not the iPhone's.&#160;<a href="#fnref-20530:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
