<p>My sister Jamie is getting married to Ives today (tonight actually).  It's hard to believe that the day is actually here.  It's a smaller wedding and so there isn't _as_ much to worry about - but there's still lots of little details to iron out (including my shirt).  It's an interesting run up to the day of the wedding to see how well the family copes with all the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lemon/1737305/">stress</a> and when the wedding finally happens and goes fine, how relaxed and calm everyone is after.</p>
<p>Enough contemplation.  More work to do.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/jamieandives">Watch for pictures as they get added here.</a>  <strong>I changed</strong> the picture set to a group that anyone can join.  Leave me a comment if you'd like to be included and can't get in right now.</p>
