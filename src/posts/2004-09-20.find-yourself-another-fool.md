<p>I'm still in denial that summer is over.  It just doesn't feel like we ever actually got it, ya know?  With all the craziness of back to school it feels like it's still the end of August... like I'm stuck in a time warp or something.</p>
<p>Further proof that I've sold my soul (besides all your email addresses) to <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> in the next couple of posts.</p>
<p>Currently grooving on Ben Harper's Diamonds on the Inside.  Sometimes the right songs come on iTunes and fits exactly my mood.  Usually I go with quick fixes (U2, DMB, Jars, Radiohead) or guilty pleasures (Timberlake...  uhm...  help me out here).  But this Harper album is just what I needed to hear tonight.</p>
