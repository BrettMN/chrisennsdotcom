<p><a href="http://www.mennoboy.com/chris/images/goodfriday/">Sue and I went for a walk down by the river on Good Friday.</a>  It was nice to get out of the house after being cooped up working on videos, web pages and BF:Vietnam all week.  Well, not really "working" on BF, but that's beside the point.</p>
<p>One more perfomance on Sunday to go, but I'm only involved with my guitar for a couple of songs.  It should be interesting to see how the rockin choir is recieved.  The band is having fun regardless.</p>
<p>The Tenebrae services went well - not without their own little glitches but nothing that noticeable to the audience I think.  It's always fun to play with Brent and his djembe.  We talked about hooking up to try and make some tv commercials for some of his audio clients - we'll see what happens.  Watch for a casting call soon!  :)</p>
