<p>If <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2012/02/lion-10-7-3-update-released/">yesterday's update</a> is causing you issues - <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/2/2766036/mac-os-x-10-7-3-update-sever-app-crashes">weird CUI errors that crash apps</a> - then <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1484">downloading the combo update</a> might be what's needed before you start running to your backups, <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/02/02/os-x-10-7-3-causing-cui-errors-for-some-combo-update-recommende/">according to this post on TUAW</a>.</p>
<p>The combo updater is the full 10.7.3 fix, including all minor upgrades/patches released between 10.7.2 and 10.7.3. The update that you download from Software Update is a delta update - which only includes the most recent changes that your computer doesn't already have.</p>
