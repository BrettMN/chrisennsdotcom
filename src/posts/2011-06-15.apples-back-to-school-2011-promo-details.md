<p>Kind of lame that it's dropped from being a free iPod touch (roughly $200CDN) to a $100 gift card for the iTunes Music/App Store or Mac App Store. Makes a lot of sense from Apple's perspective but I'm sure there will be a lot of disappointed folks who had waited until back to school time to buy their new Mac and iPod touch.</p>
<p>In my former life as an employee at the University Computer Store it was always a popular promo that helped move a ton of Apple hardware.</p>
