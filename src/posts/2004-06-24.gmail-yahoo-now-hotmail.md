<p>It's great to see a little healthy competition still works: <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/aplocal_story.asp?category=6420&amp;slug=Microsoft%20Hotmail">Hotmail is bumping up their storage levels to 250MB</a> and adding enhanced virus scanning.</p>
<p>Still doesn't have the 'coolness' of Google's gmail, but at least it removes the storage issue.</p>
