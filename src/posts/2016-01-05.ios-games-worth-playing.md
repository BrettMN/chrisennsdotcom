<p><a href="http://lazerwalker.com/ios-games-list/" target="_blank">Here's a great list of games for your iPhone or iPad to check out</a> if you're already bored with whatever Santa brought you over the holidays.</p>
<blockquote><p>Every so often, a friend asks me for iOS game recommendations. I scramble around to see what I currently have installed on my phone, and invariably end up neglecting to mention one of my favorite games.Â I thus give you the definitive list of iOS games that I think are worth playing.</p></blockquote>
