<p><a href="http://www.20six.co.uk/kellypeters">Kelly</a> loaned me his copy of Season 1 of The Office a few weeks ago.  I hadn't actually had a chance to sit down and watch it until this weekend.  Hilarious.  It's a bit crude a times, but then it's much like life... full of man-whores and drunken debauchery.</p>
