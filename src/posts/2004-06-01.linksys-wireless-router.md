<p>Any of you geeks out there with a Linksys WRT54G (802.11G wireless router) or thinking about getting one should take a look at this one from Linksys.  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20040527.html">There's a whole bunch of cool, nerdy things</a> that can be done with it and Linux, which it's running on.</p>
<p>Anyone want to buy a Hawking 802.11b wireless router so I can play with (and break) a WRT54G?</p>
