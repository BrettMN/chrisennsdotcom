Most Tuesday mornings at 10:30am CST I stream live [on my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/lemonpodcasting/). I generally talk about podcasting questions that have come up, play a video game, or break my website, while having a coffee break.

I also publish tutorial videos about podcasting and live streaming on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/lemonproductionsca).


## Watch Live

<!-- Add a placeholder for the Twitch embed -->
<div id="twitch-embed"></div>

<!-- Load the Twitch embed script -->
<script src="https://embed.twitch.tv/embed/v1.js"></script>

<!-- Create a Twitch.Embed object that will render within the "twitch-embed" root element. -->
<script type="text/javascript">
new Twitch.Embed("twitch-embed", {
width: 854,
height: 480,
channel: "lemonpodcasting",
autoplay: "true",
});
