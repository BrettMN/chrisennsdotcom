Inspired by <a href="https://wesbos.com/uses/">Wes Bos' /Uses/ page</a>, I thought I'd create one of my own.

Feel free to ask any questions in the comments at the bottom of the page or <a href="https://twitter.com/ichris">on Twitter</a>. Most stuff doesn't have affiliate links included but some does.

### Editor + Terminal

* <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> is what I write show notes in, edit HTML/CSS in, and copy quick notes to when I worry I'll forget about it. 
* I don't spend a lot of time in Terminal but when I do, I use the built in Terminal included with macOS.

### Desktop &amp; Web Apps

* I've used <a href="https://smilesoftware.com/textexpander">TextExpander</a> for many years to keep shortcuts and address details I can't be bothered to remember in.
* For to do's and reminders, I use <a href="https://ticktick.com/">TickTick</a> on macOS / iOS.
* I write draft posts, journal, meeting minutes, and track when my kid's are sick using <a href="https://dayone.me">Day One</a> for macOS / iOS. 
* For group projects and some client work, I've been enjoying using <a href="http://notion.so">Notion</a>. I'm on the personal plan and use it a lot as I discover and learn more about how to use it.
* For group chatting, I use a combination of <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> and <a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a> - though I'm down to only 2 active Slack groups as more and more have moved to Discord.
* <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com">Pixelmator Pro</a> is my photo and graphic editor of choice. Worth every penny that I don't have to spend on a monthly Adobe Creative Suite subscription.
* I use <a href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a> for time tracking projects and <a href="https://www.xero.com/ca/">Xero</a> for invoicing because it supports multi-currency account tracking.
* <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704">Amphetamine</a> is a useful (and free) app for making sure your Mac stays awake.
* I use a mixture of <a href="http://db.tt/czHe7sK">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://droplr.com">Droplr</a>, and <a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a> for sharing files with clients.
* I picked up <a href="https://cleanshot.com/">Cleanshot</a> for taking screen shots and video clips to easily share.
* Besides <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250">Time Machine</a> on macOS, I also pay for <a href="https://www.backblaze.com">Backblaze</a> to back up my MacBook Pro offsite.
* I use <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com">Spark</a> for email on macOS / iOS. Initially it was because it was one of the few email clients that supported snoozing email to a later date. It's also a very nice looking email client.
* <a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> on macOS / iOS is my Twitter client of choice - but I find myself using <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter.com</a> more often because of 3rd party apps inability to see notifications, support reading threading, and other issues.
* My web browser preference is currently <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">Microsoft Edge for Mac</a> because it works just like Google Chrome without all the Google garbage.

### Audio / Video Related

For my <a href="https://www.lemonproductions.ca">podcast editing / production business</a>, I use a few apps that might be of interest to some:

* <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/">Apple Logic Pro X</a> is the audio editor I use for 99% of my work.
* Occasionally I'll break out Rogue Amoeba's <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/fission/">Fission</a> to quickly touch up an MP3 with it's fantastic lossless MP3 editing ability.
* I also use Rogue Amoeba's <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/">Audio Hijack</a> to record backups of almost every podcast recording I do - and sometimes it is the only recording.
* Rogue Amoeba's (sensing a theme?) <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/">Loopback</a> is indispensable for setting up weird audio devices to allow me to route audio wherever and whenever I want it to go.
* <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/farrago/">Farrago</a>, by Rogue Amoeba, is the best looking soundboard app for macOS. The bar was pretty low but Rogue Amoeba leapt way over the top in my opinion.
* One final Rogue Amoeba app is <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/">SoundSource</a>. It's the volume / audio control macOS should be built with.
* I switch between Ecamm's <a href="https://www.ecamm.com/mac/ecammlive/">Ecamm Live</a> and <a href="https://obsproject.com">OBS Studio</a> for live streaming to <a href="http://goodstuff.fm/twitch/">Twitch</a>, YouTube, etc.
* <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/products/repair-and-edit/rx.html">Izotope's RX suite</a> is my go to for cleaning up audio.
* Marco Arment's <a href="https://overcast.fm/forecast">Forecast</a> is the MP3 chapter encoder app I generally use. I was using <a href="https://auphonic.com">Auphonic's</a> Desktop app but it's been awhile since it's seen updates. (If you're curious, <a href="https://www.lemonproductions.ca/how-to-add-chapter-markers-to-podcasts/">I recorded a video screencast</a> of how I use Forecast + Logic Pro X to add chapter markers to podcasts.
* Speaking of screencasts, <a href="https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/">Screenflow</a> is the app I use to record all the screencasts I do for both my <a href="http://youtube.com/c/lemonproductionsca?sub_confirmation=1">YouTube channel</a> as well as for demoing ideas or projects to clients.
* All podcasts I create/produce are hosted on <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=chris">Transistor.fm</a>.</li></ul>

### Hardware &amp; Gear

* My primary work machine is a 2019 16" MacBook Pro with a 2.3GHz i9, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD.
* I love the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ2R2LL/A/magic-trackpad-2-silver">Apple Magic Trackpad 2</a> but I don't think I'd justify it if it hadn't come bundled with my iMac.
* I recently switched to the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/products/keyboards/mx-keys-mac-wireless-keyboard.920-009552.html">Logitech MX Keys for Mac</a> and like it a lot - other than my pinky keeps hitting the Option key instead of Control when I'm editing.
* I'm currently on a yellow iPhone 11 w/128GB. I stick to a 2 year contract for my phone because I'm not rich and fancy.
* Any audio I record is done with a <a href="https://heilsound.com/products/pr-40/">Heil PR40</a> microphone on a <a href="https://heilsound.com/products/pl2t-2/">PL-2T boom arm</a>, plugged into a <a href="https://www.tritonaudio.com/fethead.html">FetHead preamp</a>, which is plugged into a <a href="https://focusrite.com/usb-audio-interface/scarlett/scarlett-18i8">Scarlett 18i8 USB preamp</a>.
* I listen / edit with a pair of Audio Technica M50x headphones (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajdK-1CW2mE">video review available here</a>).
* My desk in my office is this Costco sold <a href="https://www.costco.ca/Tresanti-Adjustable-Desk.product.100423106.html">Tresanti Adjustable Desk</a>. You <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZ3spJlgRG6/">can watch it go up and down on this Instagram video</a>.* I sit my butt down on a version of <a href="https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/S99261003/">this LÅNGFJÄLLchair from Ikea.</a> I hated having arm rests (<em>because guitar</em>) and wheels on the bottom of my chair (<em>I work alone. Where am I wheeling to?</em>) and finally found one that works for me.
