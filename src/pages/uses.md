Inspired by <a href="https://wesbos.com/uses/">Wes Bos' /Uses/ page</a>, I thought I'd create one of my own.

Feel free to ask any questions in the comments at the bottom of the page or <a href="https://twitter.com/ichris">on Twitter</a>. Most stuff doesn't have affiliate links included but some does.

### Editor + Terminal

* <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> is what I write show notes in, edit HTML/CSS in, and copy quick notes to when I worry I'll forget about it. I had been using <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> but really like the direction Microsoft is going with their code editor.
* I don't spend a lot of time in Terminal but when I do, I use the built in Terminal included with macOS.
* Most of my <a href="https://www.lemonproductions.ca">website clients</a> are <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> based and so I've hung on to <a href="https://panic.com/coda/">Coda by Panic</a> as a FTP / editor. I'm excited to see what Panic has cooking up <a href="https://panic.com/next/">next</a> though.

### Desktop &amp; Web Apps

* I've used <a href="https://smilesoftware.com/textexpander">TextExpander</a> for many years and recently caved and upgraded to their subscription service.
* For to do's and reminders, I use <a href="https://ticktick.com/">TickTick</a> on macOS / iOS. Previously I really enjoyed using <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.
* I write draft posts, journal, meeting minutes, and track when my kid's are sick using <a href="https://dayone.me">Day One</a> for macOS / iOS. Previously I was using <a href="https://bear.app">Bear</a> which is another beautiful app for writing in - you can't go wrong with either app in my opinion. I chose Day One because I was already using it for personal projects and sorted out how to use multiple journals to keep things organized.
* For group projects and some client work, I've been enjoying using <a href="http://notion.so">Notion</a>. I haven't upgraded beyond the free plan yet because I'm not sure how to best handle the various projects I collaborate on.
* Speaking of collaboration, I use a combination of <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> and <a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a> for group chats.
* <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com">Pixelmator</a> is my photo and graphic editor of choice. I haven't upgraded to Pixelmator Pro yet but eventually I'll get sick of Pixelmator's multi-window set up and pay for the upgrade.
* I use <a href="https://clockify.me">Clockify</a> for time tracking and <a href="https://www.waveapps.com">Wave Financial</a> for invoicing.
* <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704">Amphetamine</a> is a useful (and free) app for making sure your Mac stays awake.
* I use a mixture of <a href="http://db.tt/czHe7sK">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://droplr.com">Droplr</a>, and <a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a> for sharing files with clients.
* Besides <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250">Time Machine</a> on macOS, I also pay for <a href="https://www.backblaze.com">Backblaze</a> to back up my iMac and MacBook Air in case something should happen to my office.
* I use <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com">Spark</a> for email on macOS / iOS. Initially it was because it was one of the few email clients that supported snoozing email to a later date. It's also a very nice looking email client.
* <a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> on macOS / iOS is my Twitter client of choice - but I find myself using <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter.com</a> more often because of 3rd party apps inability to see notifications, support reading threading, and other issues.
* My web browser preference goes from <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> to <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html">Chrome</a> to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/">Firefox</a>. I'd really like to start using Firefox a lot more because I think they have the user's interests at heart more than Chrome... but alas, Google is Google.</li></ul>

### Audio / Video Related

For my <a href="https://www.lemonproductions.ca">podcast editing / production business</a>, I use a few apps that might be of interest to some and of no interest to others. So here goes:

* <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/">Apple Logic Pro X</a> is the audio editor I use for 99% of my work.
* Occasionally I'll break out Rogue Amoeba's <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/fission/">Fission</a> to quickly touch up an MP3 with it's fantastic lossless MP3 editing ability.
* I also use Rogue Amoeba's <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/">Audio Hijack</a> to record backups of almost every podcast recording I do - and sometimes it is the only recording.
* Rogue Amoeba's (sensing a theme?) <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/">Loopback</a> is indispensable for setting up weird audio devices to allow me to route audio wherever and whenever I want it to go.
* <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/farrago/">Farrago</a>, by Rogue Amoeba, is the best looking soundboard app for macOS. The bar was pretty low but Rogue Amoeba leapt way over the top in my opinion.
* One final Rogue Amoeba app is <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/">SoundSource</a>. It's the volume / audio control macOS should be built with.
* I switch between Ecamm's <a href="https://www.ecamm.com/mac/ecammlive/">Ecamm Live</a> and <a href="https://obsproject.com">OBS Studio</a> for live streaming to <a href="http://goodstuff.fm/twitch/">Twitch</a>, YouTube, etc.
* <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/products/repair-and-edit/rx.html">Izotope's RX suite</a> is my go to for cleaning up audio.
* Marco Arment's <a href="https://overcast.fm/forecast">Forecast</a> is the MP3 chapter encoder app I generally use. I was using <a href="https://auphonic.com">Auphonic's</a> Desktop app but it's been awhile since it's seen updates. (If you're curious, <a href="https://www.lemonproductions.ca/how-to-add-chapter-markers-to-podcasts/">I recorded a video screencast</a> of how I use Forecast + Logic Pro X to add chapter markers to podcasts.
* Speaking of screencasts, <a href="https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/">Screenflow</a> is the app I use to record all the screencasts I do for both my <a href="http://youtube.com/c/lemonproductionsca?sub_confirmation=1">YouTube channel</a> as well as for demoing ideas or projects to clients.
* All podcasts I create/produce are hosted on <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=chris">Transistor.fm</a>.</li></ul>

### Hardware &amp; Gear

* My primary work machine is a 27" 2015 Retina 5K iMac w/16GB of RAM, Radeon R9 w/4GB of RAM, and a 2TB Fusion Drive. It's hard to believe this computer is 4 years old as it still feels just as snappy as day 1 (other than when I want to play Fortnite poorly.)
* I love the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ2R2LL/A/magic-trackpad-2-silver">Apple Magic Trackpad 2</a> but I don't think I'd justify it if it hadn't come bundled with my iMac. I also love the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA22LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english">Apple Magic Keyboard</a> - but at the time I bought it, they didn't have the full size-size <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQ052LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-us-english-silver">Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad</a> which I'll be buying whenever I upgrade my iMac in the future. Apple keyboards and trackpads suck for gaming.
* For coffee shops and times away from the office, I use a 2018 MacBook Air w/4GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD.
* I'm currently on a black iPhone 8 w/64GB. I stick to a 2 year contract for my phone because I'm not rich and fancy. The yellow iPhone XR looks real nice though for <a href="https://www.lemonproductions.ca">obvious reasons</a>.
* Any audio I record is done with a <a href="https://heilsound.com/products/pr-40/">Heil PR40</a> microphone on a <a href="https://heilsound.com/products/pl2t-2/">PL-2T boom arm</a>, plugged into a <a href="https://www.tritonaudio.com/fethead.html">FetHead preamp</a>, which is plugged into a <a href="https://focusrite.com/usb-audio-interface/scarlett/scarlett-18i8">Scarlett 18i8 USB preamp</a>.
* I listen / edit with a pair of Audio Technica M50x headphones (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajdK-1CW2mE">video review available here</a>).
* My desk in my office is this Costco sold <a href="https://www.costco.ca/Tresanti-Adjustable-Desk.product.100423106.html">Tresanti Adjustable Desk</a>. You <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZ3spJlgRG6/">can watch it go up and down on this Instagram video</a>.* I sit my butt down on a version of <a href="https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/S99261003/">this LÅNGFJÄLLchair from Ikea.</a> I hated having arm rests (<em>because guitar</em>) and wheels on the bottom of my chair (<em>I work alone. Where am I wheeling to?</em>) and finally found one that works for me.
