<p>A few services and products I recommend around the web:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="mac-apps/">Mac Apps in my dock</a></li>
<li><a href="woothemes/">WordPress &amp; WooThemes</a></li>
<li><a href="freshbooks/">FreshBooks Invoicing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a few other things I recommend using in your pursuit of online excellence. Wherever possible I'm making use of affiliate links so that you can support me and this blog if you decide to use any of these services.</p>
<h3>Basic Website Hosting</h3>
<p><a href="https://chrisenns.com/dreamhost">Dreamhost</a> has been my hosting platform of choice for years now and aside from a few minor hiccups here and there I've had nary an issue with any of the sites I've hosted with them. One click installs for software like WordPress, IMAP email support, and a great control panel all make for a great host for most small to medium websites.  Plus they've got <a href="https://chrisenns.com/dreamhost">this great referral program</a> that will make you and I rich beyond our wildest dreams!</p>
<p><a href="https://chrisenns.com/dreamhost"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2138" title="Dreamhost" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtvjovih7/image/upload/v1585887286//234x60-a1.gif" alt="Dreamhost" width="234" height="60" border="0"></a></p>
<h3>Specialized WordPress Hosting</h3>
<p><a href="https://chrisenns.com/wpengine">WP Engine</a> is a web host dedicated to hosting specifically WordPress sites. It's all they do and they do it very well.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://chrisenns.com/wpengine" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.shareasale.com/image/41388/Feature-Fast-468x60.jpeg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>With plans starting at $29/month it's not for everyone - <a href="https://chrisenns.com/dreamhost">Dreamhost</a> should certainly suffice for most personal/small business websites - but if you don't want to take care of WordPress upgrades, data backups, malware scanning and great WordPress knowledgable support, then be sure to check out <a href="https://chrisenns.com/wpengine">WP Engine</a>.</p>
<h3>Squarespace Hosted Website</h3>
<p><a href="https://chrisenns.com/squarespace">Squarespace</a> is a powerful website building tool where your website is hosted and managed by them, but you have complete control over the layout, structure, design and content of your website without ever having to step foot into CSS or HTML code.</p>
<p><a href="https://chrisenns.com/squarespace"><br>
    <img class="aligncenter" src="http://adn.impactradius.com/display-ad/1291-38418" alt=""><br>
</a></p>
<p>But if you do want to wade into the nerd waters a bit, you can have complete control over your <a href="https://chrisenns.com/squarespace">Squarespace</a> site, starting from one of their gorgeous templates and doing all sorts of CSS inserts, layout changes and many other things that are otherwise unheard of from a website building tool like this.</p>
<p>If WordPress isn't careful, <a href="https://chrisenns.com/squarespace">Squarespace</a> could certainly eat their lunch as more and more people are less worried about plugins and messing with code and more concerned with the content of their site.</p>
<h3>Microblogging</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> is great for quick and easy posting of stuff you find around the internet.  Their own <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/why-tumblr">why Tumblr</a> site does a great job of explaining why, but my reason is because the "u" in their logo is actually an upside down "n" - clever!</p>
<h2>Photos</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> should be the home for all your online images.</p>
<h2>Videos</h2>
<p>Depending on what the purpose is, I use a combination of <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> for personal/misc. videos and <a href="http://www.vimeo.com">Vimeo</a> for videos I've spent a bit more time on.  The main reason being that Vimeo doesn't plaster the site full of ads and chrome.</p>
