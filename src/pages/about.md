This website is written by Chris Enns (surprise!), a podcast editor & producer living in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.

I own my own consulting company, [Lemon Productions](https://www.lemonproductions.ca/), where I help people & businesses build, launch, edit, and produce podcasts. What kind of podcasts? Take a look at my portfolio.

Iâ€™m also passionate about podcasting and am working on building a business around it at goodstuff.fm.
