This website is written by Chris Enns (surprise!), a podcast editor & producer living in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.

I own my own consulting company, [Lemon Productions](https://www.lemonproductions.ca/), where I help people & businesses build, launch, edit, and produce podcasts. What kind of podcasts? Take a look at my portfolio.

Iâ€™m also passionate about podcasting and am working on building a business around it at goodstuff.fm.

## This Blog

I started this website in 2002 with [this very insightful post](https://chrisenns.com/2002/05/going-to-edmonchuck/). My initial run of posts reads more like how we tweet these days. Not really worth going back to read but I'm a sucker for archiving all the things.
