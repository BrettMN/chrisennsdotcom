      <title><![CDATA[The United States of Guns]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>Like many of you, I read <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fedex-indianapolis-mass-shooting-e92ad3117c56357b3b2c71a2903e68a8">the news</a> of <em>a single person</em> killing <em>at least 8 people</em> in Indianapolis, Indiana yesterday, which comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/mass-shootings-2021.html">several other mass shootings in 2021</a>. While these are outrageous and horrifying events, they aren’t surprising or shocking in any way in a country where <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/">more than 33,000 people die from gun violence each year</a>.</p>

<p>America is a stuck in a Groundhog Day loop of gun violence. We’ll keep waking up, stuck in the same reality of oppression, carnage, and ruined lives until we can figure out how to effect meaningful change. I’ve collected some articles here about America’s dysfunctional relationship with guns, most of which I’ve shared before. Change is possible — there are good reasons to control the ownership of guns and control has a high likelihood of success — but how will our country find the political will to make it happen?</p>

<p><a href="https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/the-freedom-of-an-armed-society/">An armed society is not a free society</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Arendt offers two points that are salient to our thinking about guns: for one, they insert a hierarchy of some kind, but fundamental nonetheless, and thereby undermine equality. But furthermore, guns pose a monumental challenge to freedom, and particular, the liberty that is the hallmark of any democracy worthy of the name — that is, freedom of speech. Guns do communicate, after all, but in a way that is contrary to free speech aspirations: for, guns chasten speech.</p>

<p>This becomes clear if only you pry a little more deeply into the N.R.A.’s logic behind an armed society. An armed society is polite, by their thinking, precisely because guns would compel everyone to tamp down eccentric behavior, and refrain from actions that might seem threatening. The suggestion is that guns liberally interspersed throughout society would cause us all to walk gingerly — not make any sudden, unexpected moves — and watch what we say, how we act, whom we might offend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2012/12/15/our-moloch/">We’re sacrificing America’s children to “our great god Gun”</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Read again those lines, with recent images seared into our brains — “besmeared with blood” and “parents’ tears.” They give the real meaning of what happened at Sandy Hook Elementary School Friday morning. That horror cannot be blamed just on one unhinged person. It was the sacrifice we as a culture made, and continually make, to our demonic god. We guarantee that crazed man after crazed man will have a flood of killing power readily supplied him. We have to make that offering, out of devotion to our Moloch, our god. The gun is our Moloch. We sacrifice children to him daily — sometimes, as at Sandy Hook, by directly throwing them into the fire-hose of bullets from our protected private killing machines, sometimes by blighting our children’s lives by the death of a parent, a schoolmate, a teacher, a protector. Sometimes this is done by mass killings (eight this year), sometimes by private offerings to the god (thousands this year).</p>

<p>The gun is not a mere tool, a bit of technology, a political issue, a point of debate. It is an object of reverence. Devotion to it precludes interruption with the sacrifices it entails. Like most gods, it does what it will, and cannot be questioned. Its acolytes think it is capable only of good things. It guarantees life and safety and freedom. It even guarantees law. Law grows from it. Then how can law question it?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/elephant-2003">Roger Ebert on the media’s coverage of mass shootings</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me tell you a story. The day after Columbine, I was interviewed for the Tom Brokaw news program. The reporter had been assigned a theory and was seeking sound bites to support it. “Wouldn’t you say,” she asked, “that killings like this are influenced by violent movies?” No, I said, I wouldn’t say that. “But what about ‘Basketball Diaries’?” she asked. “Doesn’t that have a scene of a boy walking into a school with a machine gun?” The obscure 1995 Leonardo Di Caprio movie did indeed have a brief fantasy scene of that nature, I said, but the movie failed at the box office (it grossed only $2.5 million), and it’s unlikely the Columbine killers saw it.</p>

<p>The reporter looked disappointed, so I offered her my theory. “Events like this,” I said, “if they are influenced by anything, are influenced by news programs like your own. When an unbalanced kid walks into a school and starts shooting, it becomes a major media event. Cable news drops ordinary programming and goes around the clock with it. The story is assigned a logo and a theme song; these two kids were packaged as the Trench Coat Mafia. The message is clear to other disturbed kids around the country: If I shoot up my school, I can be famous. The TV will talk about nothing else but me. Experts will try to figure out what I was thinking. The kids and teachers at school will see they shouldn’t have messed with me. I’ll go out in a blaze of glory.”</p>

<p>In short, I said, events like Columbine are influenced far less by violent movies than by CNN, the NBC Nightly News and all the other news media, who glorify the killers in the guise of “explaining” them. I commended the policy at the Sun-Times, where our editor said the paper would no longer feature school killings on Page 1. The reporter thanked me and turned off the camera. Of course the interview was never used. They found plenty of talking heads to condemn violent movies, and everybody was happy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/04/23/battleground-america">Jill Lepore on the United States of Guns</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are nearly three hundred million privately owned firearms in the United States: a hundred and six million handguns, a hundred and five million rifles, and eighty-three million shotguns. That works out to about one gun for every American. The gun that T. J. Lane brought to Chardon High School belonged to his uncle, who had bought it in 2010, at a gun shop. Both of Lane’s parents had been arrested on charges of domestic violence over the years. Lane found the gun in his grandfather’s barn.</p>

<p>The United States is the country with the highest rate of civilian gun ownership in the world. (The second highest is Yemen, where the rate is nevertheless only half that of the U.S.) No civilian population is more powerfully armed. Most Americans do not, however, own guns, because three-quarters of people with guns own two or more. According to the General Social Survey, conducted by the National Policy Opinion Center at the University of Chicago, the prevalence of gun ownership has declined steadily in the past few decades. In 1973, there were guns in roughly one in two households in the United States; in 2010, one in three. In 1980, nearly one in three Americans owned a gun; in 2010, that figure had dropped to one in five.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/a-land-without-guns-how-japan-has-virtually-eliminated-shooting-deaths/260189/">A Land Without Guns: How Japan Has Virtually Eliminated Shooting Deaths</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only guns that Japanese citizens can legally buy and use are shotguns and air rifles, and it’s not easy to do. The process is detailed in David Kopel’s landmark study on Japanese gun control, published in the 1993 Asia Pacific Law Review, still cited as current. (Kopel, no left-wing loony, is a member of the National Rifle Association and once wrote in National Review that looser gun control laws could have stopped Adolf Hitler.)</p>

<p>To get a gun in Japan, first, you have to attend an all-day class and pass a written test, which are held only once per month. You also must take and pass a shooting range class. Then, head over to a hospital for a mental test and drug test (Japan is unusual in that potential gun owners must affirmatively prove their mental fitness), which you’ll file with the police. Finally, pass a rigorous background check for any criminal record or association with criminal or extremist groups, and you will be the proud new owner of your shotgun or air rifle. Just don’t forget to provide police with documentation on the specific location of the gun in your home, as well as the ammo, both of which must be locked and stored separately. And remember to have the police inspect the gun once per year and to re-take the class and exam every three years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/australias-gun-laws-stopped-mass-shootings-and-reduced-homicides-study-finds">Australia’s gun laws stopped mass shootings and reduced homicides, study finds</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From 1979 to 1996, the average annual rate of total non-firearm suicide and homicide deaths was rising at 2.1% per year. Since then, the average annual rate of total non-firearm suicide and homicide deaths has been declining by 1.4%, with the researchers concluding there was no evidence of murderers moving to other methods, and that the same was true for suicide.</p>

<p>The average decline in total firearm deaths accelerated significantly, from a 3% decline annually before the reforms to a 5% decline afterwards, the study found.</p>

<p>In the 18 years to 1996, Australia experienced 13 fatal mass shootings in which 104 victims were killed and at least another 52 were wounded. There have been no fatal mass shootings since that time, with the study defining a mass shooting as having at least five victims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From The Onion, <a href="https://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-this-r-1846698258">‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>At press time, residents of the only economically advanced nation in the world where roughly two mass shootings have occurred every month for the past eight years were referring to themselves and their situation as “helpless.”</p></blockquote>

<p>But America is not Australia or Japan. Dan Hodges <a href="https://twitter.com/dpjhodges/status/611943312401002496">said on Twitter a few years ago</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate. Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.</p></blockquote>

<p>This can’t be the last word on guns in America. We have to do better than this for our children and everyone else whose lives are torn apart by guns. But right now, we are failing them miserably, and Hodges’ words ring with the awful truth that all those lives and our diminished freedom &amp; equality are somehow worth it to the United States as a society.</p>

<p style="color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">As an obsessive coffee-drinker, I think about coffee a lot. Usually in a banal way, like “ooh, I’m almost out, so I should definitely walk 5 miles through the driving rain to get some more because, priorities” and “how long’s it been since my last one? Can my body handle it or is that a really bad idea? And if it’s a really bad idea, shall I do it anyway?”</p>
<p style="color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">But recently, I’ve wondered about deeper things. For example, do I like drinking coffee - or do I like having <em>drank</em> coffee? </p>
<p style="color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">I certainly seem<em> </em>to like the taste of it, and get a huge sense of satisfaction from my first sip, that rich, adult cocktail of smoky bitterness that perfectly suits the sensual extravaganza of <a href="https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJxt0ctuhSAQANCvuew0MILCgkU3_Q3DY_SSKhrA3tivL9VF06QJr2RmMpODMwXnLZ1633IhP8dYzh11xFdesBRM5MiYxuA1A9oPjALxmnsmhSQhj1NCXE1YdEkHkv2wS3CmhC1eFUxxyclTgxCWCsE5ctmzXikU3EyWdnZSSgz-bmwOHzA61PiJ6dwikkU_S9nzo3t7wHtdV6A8Q5xDNqv5qo82HzYX4z5at601Za_bRN-c25GaF-JHA417mmXBOGNuTEISNFBgtIOO9YJC37LWgXJSeAQqrBSdYxS5l24Y6sBAB_XgdJ3hTy-SNAxOuElBjf565XZC9DbEK6mKjPVejxjKOWI0dkF_Y5Xb_OIbZ4yY6l_40RTNqpFgEkAKELdN1ew4MCarf53Cb7Uq6n88vgFBdpyS" style="color: #ee7835; text-decoration: none;">being outdoors</a>. For me, tea feels like a four-walls drink, something comforting that evokes memories of warm socks, electric blankets and dozing off awkwardly in your chair in front of <em>Eastenders</em>. </p>

You drink coffee to step up, not wind down. Coffee is unsympathetic to your needs and if you don’t regulate your consumption of it, it will hijack your brain and turn it into the equivalent of a full-volume, nonstop loop of <a href="https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJxFkMuq3DAMhp8m3jVYsp04Cy8K5bTbQrsOvmhmTBNniO0T0qevZ7IoCElI-pH0eVvovu2neW65sJeby_kkk-jIC5VCO6uZ9jkGA8iHETiyYGQArTSLeb7tRKuNiyl7JfasbonelriltwImqSV7mImDQ6c8-GGUyjonuYAbkEI7gBLyWmxriJQ8Gfqk_dwSscU8SnnmTnzt8KPZcRz9udVSHfV-W18VW_yjEx-fnfj28wd--fX993JUyaJBjsAFChgUx6GH3uPktQqEXDmthAdOMmg_jiQ18nHqJF_v2OfqcrH-z2sB2w2OXvnbhK37n0nub0TBxfQeal_PLa41xXLOlKxbKFxAysX1jWi-U6K98Q6zLQaGdhhoRK1QXf83YkIigG6M2xVha6p0wSiPmO4x29X-bck_QcKQvQ" style="color: #ee7835; text-decoration: none;">Nyan Cat</a> - for <strong>hours</strong>.</p>

<p style="color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Ah, that delicious, jittery state of <em>having-had-coffee</em>.  The buzz of the caffeine, the rightness of how the day feels afterwards, the way its aftertaste can last all morning if I made it strong enough. </p>
<p style="color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">And yet I remember a time I really hated the stuff, same way I really hated my very first taste of beer in my early teens. </p>
<p style="color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Why…doesn’t that feel weirder to me? Has my coffee-addicted brain rewired itself so much that when I <em>think</em> I love the taste, I <em>actually</em> love the effect of being <a href="https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJxFkcGOhCAMhp9muGmgguKBw172NQxCnSGDYAR34j79dsbDJtA2af_0z1dnK97zfpotl8reYarnhibhq0SsFXd2FNyn4I0A3g-CA_NGeqGVZqFMy4642hBN3Q9k2zHH4GwNOX0UYpRasoeROPSg5eAB5WzVrGfpLerOdcKKEfBabA8fMDk0-IP7mROyaB61buXWfd3gm159hLJl72yprxDjk_6Zj9bllZrAgVPiw7sWFHALJXtslGxe9onNsTU2-aasGGNTH9g4uywYEtIsC4b0gnfQiV5x6FvROhidVh6Bk2PVOcFReu2GAaUGPow3ydc7tOWYS7Xu-bbBdgODU24Zgbr_EEu7IPo5pM8QYZoor0cK9Zww2TmivwjW6xAfptMdE-50ID_ZakRPxoQG0ArUBYwQdxKE0HQUcuEzqdJFj0ileyh2tb9U_AHfdKHR" style="color: #ee7835; text-decoration: none;">psychoactively drugged</a>? And if so, does coffee actually, objectively taste any good, full stop?</p>
<p style="color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Here’s a related mystery about the taste of coffee: a fair few people like it, but in my experience, <strong>everyone</strong> loves the smell of it. I have met people who deeply hate drinking coffee, who find the stuff brackish and foul, and yet will twitch their nostrils above a freshly-opened bag of ground coffee and say, “ohhhh, that smells fantastic!”</p>
<p style="color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">But I thought taste and smell were basically the same thing (which is why you can’t taste anything if you hold your nose)? And just how different <em>is</em> the smell of coffee to the taste of it - and why is that?</p>
<p style="color: #1a1a1a; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; margin: 0 0 1em 0;">Time to stop and investigate all this properly.</p>

After spending my entire adult life pouring gallons of coffee down my gullet, I’ve never taken a long, hard look at it. I could chase this topic in all sorts of directions (“is coffee bad for our health?” is an evergreen newspaper headline) but I’ll restrict myself to looking at the taste vs. the smell of it. That should be more than enough. </p>

      <title><![CDATA[Cold Lasagne Hate Myself 1999]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>This standup special by James Acaster called <a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/coldlasagne">Cold Lasagne Hate Myself 1999</a> is not only the funniest show I’ve seen in a long time but also has the best explanation of Brexit I’ve ever heard.</p>
<p>If you’ve never heard of James before (he’s very popular in the UK) then you should absolutely check out <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80213803">Repertoire</a> on Netflix; it’s 4 comedy specials back to back and I devoured them all in one night. It’s so impossibly good it makes me angry.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Tulip Mania]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>I’ve long considered <em>everything</em> related to the blockchain to be a poison but I’ve tried to keep an open mind as much as possible. I’ve never played with the technology, never bought a coin, never owned an NFT.</p>
<p>But you really don’t need to know how a scam works to know that it’s a scam.</p>
<p>One evening many years ago, I went to dinner with a friend of a friend and he excitedly bragged about betting his life savings on bitcoin and ethereum. I recognized that gleam in his eyes well—a look I had learned to spot from childhood—where a man was gloating in front of me, boasting about this vast fortune that was roaring towards him from somewhere out there on the horizon.</p>
<p>Everything he said was horseshit and it was obvious from this gleam in his eyes. He told me that the blockchain was the future of finance, bitcoin would be the bedrock of our economy, and not only that but he would become a millionaire within the next six months.</p>
<p>I’ve only studied a few economics classes but I knew then that those two things cannot be true at the same time. We can’t be building the foundations of our economy with this new financial model whilst <em>also</em> expecting to come out on top of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania">speculative tulip mania</a> as techno-wizard millionaires. That was obvious to me then and it’s more than obvious after years of folks talking about how valuable the blockchain is with nothing but a runaway bubble and an ecological disaster to show for it.</p>
<p>I sort of pitied this guy, in a way. Sure he was going to be richer than I ever will be, that much was certain. But the way he talked about money, the way he imagined himself on top of people, crunching their poor bones beneath him, the way he saw himself as the master of this vast ponzi scheme—one that only he knew how to navigate...it was pitiable, cowardly, short-sighted. I knew I had to get away from it all at light-speed.</p>
<p>In his vision of the world he didn’t need to create anything brilliant or heartwarming, needn’t build anything of any real value. There was no magic in this vision, and no wonder.</p>
<p>All he saw was a pyramid and his own place within it.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Inheritance]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>I imagine reading the blog of my grandmother: What did she do on her thirtieth birthday? How did she feel when she met my mom? What did she struggle with? Who did she love? What did her voice sound like?</p>
<p>The other day Donny Trương asked what would happen to his website <a href="https://visualgui.com/2021/02/26/inheritance/">in the future</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What will I leave my children when I die? Since I don’t have anything worthy or much money, I haven’t thought about it yet. Yesterday, Đán told me, “When you die, I will read your Visualgui.” I smiled at him and asked, “Will you and Đạo take care of it when I die?” He replied, “Sure, we will take care of it for you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought about this the other day, too. When I die my website will probably stick around until my bank account stops sending money to Hover or Netlify. I guess my brother might have the login details and could start paying for my domain name but then what? If I ever have kids will they take the keys to this thing?</p>
<p>At some point or another this website, this URL, won’t resolve though. Maybe the Internet Archive will stick around for a while, but then everything is locked within this vast archive.</p>
<p>But if my URL is dead, my website dies with it.</p>
<p>My work shouldn’t be presented in the Smithsonian behind glass or anything, I’m just pointing at this enormous flaw in the architecture of the web itself: you’re renting servers and renting URLs. Nothing is permanent because on the web we don’t really own any space, we’re just borrowing land temporarily.</p>
<p>Donny continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, Đạo mentioned that he had gone through 400 pages of my blog and read posts that were specifically about our family. He is now in 2009 and only has six more years of materials to read through. Only my own son has that much dedication to my writing and that means the whole world to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is beautiful. I would love to read my father’s notes and thoughts about what he struggled with; what links he found fascinating, what happened during the recession that crippled our family.</p>
<p>This is impossible because the web didn’t exist until he was in his late thirties. So I wonder if the web will exist for my grandchildren? And if so, then will this tragic flaw—the way the web forgets everything because you’re just renting space—destroy my life’s work for them?</p>
<p>In sixty years will my grandchildren read my blog?</p>

      <description><![CDATA[Much of Clubhouse is boring — or, at least, disproportionately filled with the awkward in-between of group interaction.

<p>She says she got advice once about directing once that was like: “the way to get respect on a set is to have three big arguments a day. Big ones that re-instate your power and remind everyone who is in charge. Be the predator.” And she says “that’s the opposite of her process and wants none of that.”</p>



<p>That’s me. I want none of that. </p>



<p>And yet at the same time, I feel I’m conflict-averse to a fault. While I think it’s generally a benefit to my life (I’m ZERO percent productive when I’m mad and arguing and for hours afterward), I also think there is a way to argue without the negativity. A middle ground that isn’t avoiding feelings for the sake of agreeableness.</p>



<p>This episode that just dropped of Hidden Brain is extremely on point here: <a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/the-easiest-person-to-fool/">The Easiest Person to Fool</a>. There are dozens of fascinating things in here, but here’s one. Adam Grant, the guest, talks about The Wright Brothers. They accomplished tons of things together and apparently argued just constantly. But they argued in this spirited-but-respectful way. Adam said going back in time to listen to them argue would be very high on his go-back-in-time-to-witness list. Someone who worked with them said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>They never got angry, but they sure got hot.</p></blockquote>



<p>Even though it’s not me, I buy into the idea that someone who isn’t particularly agreeable all the time, and argues (without the anger), makes a better leader than someone who is agreeable-at-all-costs. <audio src="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/aaea4e69-af51-495e-afc9-a9760146922b/d2c4e775-99ce-4c17-b04c-ac380133d68c/54ef3d53-bec9-4ee9-be20-acc2013d08b0/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&amp;in_playlist=2c6993d0-eac8-4252-8c4e-ac380133d69a"></audio></p>

      <title><![CDATA[Here’s How To Think About Clubhouse Audio Strategy]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h3>How to think about Clubhouse audio strategy</h3><h4>Is this new social audio platform a threat to podcasting? Spoiler: Nope. But, it’s creating an entirely new space in digital audio to serve different needs than podcasting. And talk radio might want to keep looking over its shoulder…</h4><figure><img alt="www.joinclubhouse.com" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/512/0*mgn-ZhW6FU3aa_B6"></figure><p>In the world of digital audio, it seems like everyone is talking about <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a>. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261435/elon-musk-clubhouse-podcasts-robinhood">Elon Musk debuted on the platform</a> this week!) For an invite-only, iOS-only social audio platform, there are suddenly a LOT of people on there and a LOT of people excited about it.</p><p>In May of 2020, it had <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/20/clubhouse-app-is-where-mc-hammer-and-jared-leto-chat-with-vcs.html">1,500 users and was already valued at $100M</a>. This past week, there appear to be over <a href="https://backlinko.com/clubhouse-users">2 MILLION users</a>, and with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/clubhouse-announces-plans-for-creator-payments-and-raises-new-funding-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAC3uRPw9sTPEa5uAeGiuDFhQF37b_DX-I9WgsTPwc2g4wFWehx8IP_AO4FOqFWdL3LmImy42HS9JhXvwbCLAv6v89sMhZPw5JA71U7QDkSwhpWW-w4SONnT6CsO5bVpy55Yqh5X0THJFs2XrMfd8XGaOKC7WUrqrKnX_ANIj6DVg">a reported additional investment from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz</a>, the valuation now stands at $1B. That is some serious growth in a short period of time.</p><p>So (if you can secure an invite and you have an iOS device), here are some ways to think about an audio strategy on Clubhouse…</p><p>First and foremost, whether you’re a creator or a brand, you need to answer this question: <a href="https://blog.pacific-content.com/jobs-to-be-done-for-podcasts-b9daadeec35c"><strong><em>what’s the job you’re hiring audio to do?</em></strong></a></p><p>Once you know the answer, you can determine what to make, where it should live (podcasting, Clubhouse, radio, etc), and how to use it. There are lots of great uses — and some not so great uses — for Clubhouse. Here are a few ways to think about when and where it makes sense.</p><h3>Clubhouse and Podcasting</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/776/1*R9Ses6m4ySyb9Bx18gNe8Q.png"><figcaption>EMERGENCY TOWN HALL! SOS!</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve seen <a href="https://onaudio.mattdeegan.com/p/why-clubhouse-isnt-about-audio">several</a> <a href="https://tomwebster.substack.com/p/will-clubhouse-kill-podcasting">articles</a>, many tweets, and numerous Clubhouse rooms focused on one question: will Clubhouse kill podcasting?</p><p>As with many others, my quick answer is an emphatic “NO!” Why?</p><p>Clubhouse and podcasting (mostly) serve entirely different purposes. Clubhouse is primarily being framed as “social audio,” which, by definition of the way they are distributed, is not possible for podcasts.</p><p>Podcasts are on-demand shows, in the same way that Netflix, Prime Video, and Hulu let you consume the shows you want on your own schedule. The most successful shows are very well-produced. They are often edited to increase quality. Many have narrative-based formats. They offer the possibility of rich sound design that creates scenes and emotions in your mind. I know there are many exceptions and that there are a LOT of unedited talk podcasts, but…</p><p>Clubhouse, so far, has none of those attributes. None.</p><p>However, Clubhouse is able to do all sorts of things that podcasting can’t, too. If you want to create a live show, if you want to interact with an audience as part of the show, and if you want to be real-time topical, Clubhouse is a much better option than starting a podcast.</p><p>Many years ago, I was working with <a href="https://medium.com/u/d7f2b0c9b8e0">Jonas Woost</a> (<a href="https://medium.com/u/38c5303342eb">Pacific Content</a>’s Director of Strategy) at CBC Radio. He led me through an exercise of making a very basic chart to determine which platforms we should use for which purposes. I’ve created a similar chart to show where you might decide to use a podcast, or you might decide to use Clubhouse, based on what your strategic needs might be.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*E3MVzdhJzznQGLBZajgADQ.png"></figure><p>Not a lot of overlap here.</p><p>(This is not to say that some creative minds will not figure out how to add narrative layers to a Clubhouse room or that some brilliant experiments will allow for ‘theatre of the mind.’ In fact, it feels like that will indeed happen at some point if Clubhouse continues on its current trajectory.)</p><p>I’m writing this on the same afternoon that Jeff Bezos announced he would be stepping down as CEO of Amazon and there could not be a better example of what Clubhouse is perfectly suited for. Right now, there are several different rooms focused exclusively on the Bezos news:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mNvrduc4YrTKPr1eeqSFwA.png"></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HmkmVttEJ5hG3H4P7KTpOg.png"></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GD1kQ-ms0RsyPfJW9JDXEQ.png"></figure><p>By definition, there is no podcast that can be this reactive in real-time. This is a space that Clubhouse can own. And as a brand or creator, if you want to provide hot, spicy takes on real-time current events, it makes a lot of sense to use Clubhouse.</p><h3>Clubhouse and Talk Radio</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*bg4UCP5nrDFl8D9A"><figcaption>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@nittygritty_photo?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Fringer Cat</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/radio?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Here’s where areas for Clubhouse disruption get more interesting for me… Clubhouse has much more in common with talk radio than podcasting.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*imKmIgIj-1eLZl439TYguA.png"></figure><p>Now that’s a lot of overlap.</p><p>For those in the talk radio business, Clubhouse could be both a disruptor and an opportunity. Disruptive because you now have millions of people signed up to a live audio platform that isn’t terrestrial radio, and thousands of new hosts (moderators) competing for the time and attention of audiences.</p><p>However, it’s also an opportunity because people who are really good at live talk radio have the potential to be AMAZING on Clubhouse. My relatively limited experience on Clubhouse so far suggests that there are a LOT of unprepared moderators, a LOT of unfocused conversations, and a <a href="https://webby2001.medium.com/youre-going-to-ruin-clubhouse-eecb1367781f">LOT of room for improvement</a> on the quality of audio and the <a href="https://onaudio.mattdeegan.com/p/why-clubhouse-isnt-about-audio">quality of show</a> on Clubhouse.</p><p>Talk radio knows how to do all this. If you work in talk radio, your skill sets could be very portable to Clubhouse and provide you with a significant advantage. Jump in and make an amazing live show!</p><h3>Clubhouse and Conferences</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*yKZ4PYNgXk28cx6T"><figcaption>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@samuelpereira?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Samuel Pereira</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/conference?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Clubhouse also has a lot in common with conferences.</p><p>In our current pandemic era, almost no one has been hit harder than live events. (Just looking at the photo above makes me uncomfortable — WHERE IS THE DISTANCING? WHERE ARE THE MASKS?)</p><p>There is simply no way to gather large numbers of people together safely at any time soon. So what happens to all those conferences where entire industries gather to learn and share information with each other?</p><p>Maybe… it’s Clubhouse.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hn9wTp0G9foqIvyRjPy39A.png"></figure><p>I can’t see myself signing up for several days of all-Zoom panels and keynotes at virtual conferences. I already spend far too much time in front of a screen and the thought of voluntarily opting-in to hours more video fills me with dread and despair.</p><p>BUT… the thought of having panels, fireside chats, and well moderated Q&amp;As on my walks, on in the background while I work or cook or clean? I am very open to that.</p><p>And it looks like many people are already using Clubhouse for conference-style topics. As I write this, here are a few rooms that I could easily see on a conference agenda:</p><ul>
<li>SaaS Growth</li>
<li>Apple AR/VR</li>
<li>Transitioning From Residential to Commercial Real Estate</li>
<li>Diversity in the Voiceover Industry</li>
<li>WTF is UX Writing?</li>
</ul><p>(I actually think I’ve been to conferences with some of these panel themes…)</p><p>Would a traditional podcast make lots of sense for a conference? Yes — and I think more conferences should consider moving to podcasts while we can’t gather in person.</p><p>Would Clubhouse also make lots of sense for a conference? Yes — especially if interactivity is a core value. Clubhouse also feels like an area where conferences could replicate break-out rooms for networking in a way that is impossible for podcasts.</p><h3>Clubhouse and TV After Shows</h3><p>Here’s one more Clubhouse opportunity — TV After Shows. The place where loyal fans of shows gather to hear inside dirt and to gossip about the episode everyone just finished watching.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CESWamqr9pvoK_YDsgcAvQ.jpeg"></figure><p>Who loves The Bachelor? Lots of us.</p><p>Who listens to Bachelor-themed podcasts recapping the last episode? Lots of us.</p><p>Who should be making an official After Show Room on Clubhouse on Monday nights? The Bachelor.</p><p>Here’s why:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*T-SmsBroDwZDHj6TRo_9SQ.png"></figure><p>So let’s get Chris Harrison, plus past and present cast, to do a one-hour After Show Room immediately after each episode. Make sure to have some Q&amp;A and interaction and I bet <a href="https://bachelornation.com/">Bachelor Nation</a> would pour into Clubhouse in droves.</p><h3>Early Clubhouse Audio Strategy Thoughts</h3><p>So what can we take away from these simple charts?</p><p>Clubhouse is not here to destroy podcasting.</p><p>There are digital audio opportunities for talk radio, conferences, and TV that take full advantage of Clubhouse’s strengths.</p><p>Clubhouse is here to serve new needs in new ways in digital audio.</p><p>As you develop your audio strategy, play to the strengths of the medium and the platform.</p><p>Finally, while Clubhouse and podcasting do serve different purposes, the strategies for success in both are similar:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Value time &amp; attention. </strong>You are asking people to give you their most valuable asset — their time and attention. So don’t waste it. Listeners will not suffer mediocrity for long.</li>
<li>
<strong>Know your audience.</strong> Who is your Clubhouse room for? How is your room creating unique value for that community? Your room is for them, not for you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Quality matters.</strong> Moderate your room from a quiet environment. Use the best microphone option you can find for your phone. Learn how to moderate a room well. Listeners remember and appreciate quality.</li>
<li>
<strong>Prepare.</strong> There is a temptation with the ability to “go live” at a moment’s notice to wing it. Great live shows have a ton of preparation that goes on before the show, and a lot of hard work during the show to make things appear seamless and smooth.</li>
<li>
<strong>Have fun.</strong> Try new ideas. This is a really new platform. Just like podcasting, almost nothing has been invented yet. There is going to be a lot of creative experimentation in this space, so don’t be held back by what you see in Clubhouse today. Invent the show that hasn’t been invented yet.</li>
<li>
<strong>Make a great show. </strong>In short, you are putting on a show every time you start a room. Make the best possible show you can. Earn trust over time by being consistently great. Earn time and attention over and over again by creating new value every time you open up a room.</li>

      <title><![CDATA[Ow, My Back]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We officially went into quarantine on March 22. One hot afternoon in June, I found myself in the garage with a pair of shears, a screwdriver, and a hammer so I could cut an inch of leather off my belt and punch a new hole.</p>
<p>All in all, I had lost twenty pounds by doing nothing. At least not intentionally. It was merely due to skipping meals (no more lunch out at work every day), the food I did eat was almost always cooked at home, and I had cut out my twice-daily can of soda from the office fridge. (Not to mention a heaping daily dose of existential dread, anxiety, and fear.)</p>
<p>Small changes, but over three months, they added up. Fast-forward to October 1, when <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/tylerhall/status/1311753146729988102">I tweeted this</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the start of COVID, I've punched three holes in this belt and cut off an inch of leather two times. Today, it finally went in the trash, and I bought a smaller size. Not everything in 2020 has turned out awful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://cdn.tyler.io/blog/covid-belt.jpg" alt="COVID Belt"></p>
<p>I lost weight and was certainly medically healthier. But did I feel better? Not at all. By May, I was hurting. The next month I was in <em>pain</em>. That summer was nothing but agony from muscle and skeletal pain.</p>
<p>I knew what the problem was. I've sat in front of a computer some portion of almost every day of my life for the past thirty years. And I've <em>always</em> had terrible posture. Add that on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourette_syndrome">Tourette's syndrome</a>, and I'm amazed I've even gotten this far in life without my body completely revolting at one more hour hunched over a keyboard.</p>
<p>(I've talked about this a little, but I was formally diagnosed with Tourette's twelve years ago. It's a motor tic disorder, which means I twitch all the time. And when I try to control and repress my tics or when I'm physically unable to let them happen, my body becomes incredibly sore from <em>trying</em> to twitch.)</p>
<p>Coincidentally, as I've been drafting this post over the past few weeks, I read an article in <em>The Atlantic</em> titled <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/quarantine-giving-you-headaches-back-pain-and-more/617672/">"Yes, the Pandemic Is Ruining Your Body: Quarantine is turning you into a stiff, hunched-over, itchy, sore, headachy husk."</a> It goes into data behind so many people coming to doctors with non-COVID medical problems brought on by the switch to working from home, shitty ergonomics, longer working hours, and, yes, stress.</p>
<p>And so, bingo. My excruciating back and neck pain. Not being able to sit on a couch without feeling like there was a lump in my throat (yes, I got <em>that</em> checked out) and a hot poker in the base of my neck. Or the tingling sensation from the heel of my foot up the side of my left leg as I made the short walk from my home office to the garage fridge for a Coke Zero.</p>
<p>Those were all the many ways my body decided to tell me, "Yo, none of this is healthy, and you're gonna be real fucked up soon if you don't find a better way of working (less)."</p>
<p>So, I listened. And five months later, I feel so many light-years better than I did that when I think back to mid-2020 that I can only gasp and wonder how I got any work done at all.</p>
<p>This post is all the fun, nerdy details that went into making my home and work offices more comfortable. It was a bit of self-preservation mixed with stress-shopping. But if you want the TL;DR, I can sum it up with two words:</p>
<p>Stop. Sitting.</p>
<p>There's more nuance to that, but I'll get there. First, I'm going to be upfront and say that (where possible) the product links below are affiliate URLs. However, next to each link, I also include a non-affiliate URL. Everything I list is what I purchased and (most importantly) ended up sticking with and whole-heartedly recommend. If you find the links useful and want to throw a few Amazon bucks my way, you're awesome. If not, then I hope you find these links helpful regardless.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>I've had a love affair with office chairs for years. I <a href="https://tyler.io/my-favorite-chair/">wrote about my favorite one</a> back in 2014 that I liked so much I bought two. But even with my back wrapped in the warm, Silicon Valley-esque embrace of a Herman Miller chair, my body was having no more of it.</p>
<p>I naively thought, "Ten years in the same chair. I just need something different." I didn't want to spend that kind of money again, so <a href="https://amzn.to/2XYJggW">I settled on this cheap (but not horribly cheap by office chair standards) model</a> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HFT9KI2/">non-affiliate link</a>).</p>
<p>It was sturdy, sat mostly OK, and the back support was adequate. My only real complaint was I found the armrests too high even in their lowest position.</p>
<p>I bought that chair in June, but it was clear my back and neck problems weren't going away by August. (Yes, I'm doing more throughout this whole period than just switching out chairs. Taking more breaks, daily walks, etc.)</p>
<p>I didn't see any way forward other than just not sitting eight or more hours a day. I last used a standing desk briefly at a job in 2013. But it didn't last. It was a fixed height (and incorrect for me), and I stood on hard commercial carpeting on top of cement. I wasn't optimistic I'd be able to go full-time standing, but I wanted to try.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to get a motorized desk at work; I did more online research and found this highly recommended <a href="https://amzn.to/2XVfF87">standing mat</a> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V3TO9EK/">non-affiliate link</a>) from <a href="https://ergodriven.com/">Ergodriven</a>. Instead of being flat, this one has "terrain," as they call it - raised edges and a center "dome" that encourage you to keep your legs and feet moving more than you would if standing on a flat surface.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.tyler.io/blog/standing-mat.jpg" alt="Ergodriven Standing Mat"></p>
<p>It's quite wonderful. Comfortable in sock feet, sturdy when I wear shoes, and I've developed a habit of naturally angling my feet on the raised portion to stretch my legs as I work. I also bought a second one for my standing desk at home (more on that in a bit).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.tyler.io/blog/amazon-mat.jpg" alt="Ergodriven Standing Mat on Amazon"></p>
<p>Speaking of standing desks, I think I was always hesitant to move to one because I've heard for years that the inexpensive ones are crap, and only the premium (trendy?) ones are worth the money.</p>
<p>So after standing full time for two months at work, I declared my standing desk experiment a success. My wife (amazingly) was all for me getting one at home, too. I liked the one I had in my office but assumed it was in the $700+ range. <a href="https://amzn.to/394argZ">I asked my boss and was delighted to find out, nope</a>. $280 🎉 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q3V4PWQ/">non-affiliate link</a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.tyler.io/blog/office-desk.jpg" alt="Office Standing Desk"></p>
<p>You'll notice in that photo of my office desk my monitor is raised to a comfortable eye-level using a very classy <a href="https://moonpie.com/">MoonPie</a> collectible tin. I wanted something just as nice for my iMac at home. I couldn't find a <a href="https://www.littledebbie.com">Little Debbie</a> collectible tin, so I settled on a <a href="https://amzn.to/35W464V">HiRise stand</a> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077J3F5MP/">non-affiliate link</a>) from the lovely folks at <a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/">Twelve South</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.tyler.io/blog/hirise1.jpg" alt="Twelve South HiRise Pro"></p>
<p>It matches the iMac's finish, and the front panel flips down to reveal storage. Also, the thing weighs a million pounds. Any computer or monitor you sit on top <em>is not</em> going anywhere - believe me.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.tyler.io/blog/hirise2.jpg" alt="Twelve South HiRise Pro"></p>
<p>Next up, I work all hours of the day and night. I did have an old table lamp on the corner of my desk (overhead lighting is the devil), but it had a huge base and lampshade, which took up more desk space than I'd like. I wanted something smaller and ideally with an adjustable temperature bulb. (I'd prefer not to reach for an app just to control a "smart" bulb.)</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/36dM26P">I found this one</a> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00APAQSP6/">non-affiliate link</a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.tyler.io/blog/lamp1.jpg" alt="LED Lamp"></p>
<p>It's skinny and has three points of adjustment, so I can freely reposition it as needed. And if you look closely here</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.tyler.io/blog/lamp2.jpg" alt="LED Lamp"></p>
<p>You can tap to switch the LED between four color temperatures - cool to warm. And it's hard to see in that photo, but the white/gray rectangle in the middle has + and - buttons to adjust the brightness.</p>
<p>You may be wondering about that large, silver box in the first lamp photo. That is an amazing device from <a href="https://www.yottamaster.com/">Yottamaster</a> that I should have bought years ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/tylerhall/status/1340795831587397632">On December 20 I tweeted</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the first time in my adult life I am at peace with the cable organization behind my desk. Ending 2020 on a high note.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My iMac serves as the media and storage hub for my family. All of our movies and TV shows, music, photos, everything - stored on (currently) an 8TB and 12TB external drive.</p>
<p>I've never wanted to go all-in on a real NAS for various reasons. I've rolled my own over the network with a Raspberry Pi and <a href="https://www.openmediavault.org/">openmediavault</a>, which worked surprisingly well. But nothing beats the performance of having drives connected directly and the insanely affordable <a href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/00ggbd">Backblaze</a> pricing for tethered drives (<a href="https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup.html">non-affiliate link</a>).</p>
<p>But it always drove me crazy giving up USB ports for multiple drives. And especially the awfulness of giant power bricks and their cables. I have no idea why I never thought to look for something like this before, but <a href="https://amzn.to/3bWd2en">that silver box is perfect for my needs</a> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XKWNJSB/">non-affiliate link</a>).</p>
<p>It's just a hard drive enclosure with four bays. But it's <em>not</em> RAID or anything fancy like that. It's a single power cable and a single USB cable. But each drive mounts individually on my Mac as if they were all plugged in separately. I don't want the overhead of dealing with a RAID array. I'm perfectly content spanning my data across multiple drives myself, so this is a terrific and inexpensive solution.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.tyler.io/blog/yotta2.jpg" alt="Yottamaster 4 Bay Hard Drive Enclosure"></p>
<p>All right, we're near to the end. One more thing for my desk. One more thing for my feet.</p>
<p>After standing full-time at work beginning in August and then doing the same at home in October, my legs <em>hurt</em>. Don't get me wrong. It wasn't the scary tingling sensation I had before or a painfully sore neck; this was just regular muscle soreness from being out of shape. I knew that my legs would adjust and get stronger with time, and they did.</p>
<p>But what I didn't expect was around the time my legs stopped aching, the soles of my feet and especially my heel <em>really</em> began to hurt. At this point, I'm sure I was standing (and walking / moving) ten or more hours a day, thanks to an out of whack work/life balance. My back and neck had recovered by no longer sitting with poor posture all day, but now my feet were screaming. Fiery pins and needles type pain.</p>
<p>I could tell the standing mat helped, and so did taking breaks on the couch for conference calls. Ultimately, all the advice I read online agreed with an email response from my doctor, who I'm sure thinks I'm an idiot for not thinking of the fix myself.</p>
<p>Change your shoes, dummy.</p>
<p>At home, I was standing in my sock feet all day. And at work, I was in sneakers the whole time. Neither option was very supportive - and even if they were, standing the same way all day every day isn't going to feel good.</p>
<p>Again, I researched online and talked to two friends who are nurses (walking in hospitals for 12+ hour shifts). I went with their recommendation and bought a pair of <a href="https://amzn.to/3qBe3wB">Dansko clogs</a> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078WG5XDL/">non-affiliate link</a>). They're not particularly good looking (a co-worker laughed), but they're hella supportive when standing.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.tyler.io/blog/clogs.jpg" alt="Dansko Clogs"></p>
<p>My new routine is to switch between the clogs and sock feet every few hours throughout the day. Since making that adjustment in December, my feet are no longer in pain.</p>
<p>Finally, rounding out my home office, the only thing I don't like about my desk is the desktop is so smooth it's borderline slippery. It just doesn't feel comfortable under my writs, and my keyboard will occasionally slide out of place.</p>
<p>I totally get this is a huge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_and_the_Pea">Princess and the Pea</a> situation, but so be it. I wanted something that looked and felt nice and found <a href="https://grovemade.com/product/wool-felt-desk-pad/?initial=475">this desk pad</a> from <a href="https://grovemade.com/">Grovemade</a>. Made of wool, feels great, nothing slides around anymore, and they even included a handwritten thank-you note with the order. So, three cheers for well-made products from friendly companies.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.tyler.io/blog/grovemade1.jpg" alt="Grovemade Wool Desk Pad"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.tyler.io/blog/grovemade2.jpg" alt="Grovemade Wool Desk Pad"></p>
<p>That's it. That's my 2020 journey from sedentary pain, losing a little extra weight, upending my posture, and then falling down a rabbit hole of fussy home-office accessories. Like I said earlier, it was a bit of getting healthier along with some retail therapy to get through a genuinely shitty year for our world.</p>
<p>Happy 2021, and stay safe out there, folks.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Letterhead wants to be the Shopify of email newsletters]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’re probably investing in an email newsletter these days, whether you’re an international brand, a nonprofit or a local news publisher.</p>
<p>Maybe email is even your focus now, because you got burned by Facebook, Google or other closed platforms during the past decade. The problem is that the tools you have available are probably too generic, or are built specifically for marketers. What if you want to make money from the newsletter content itself?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tryletterhead.com/">Letterhead</a> is slicing through the vast market of existing email SaaS products, betting that a cross-section of revenue and collaboration needs are not being met properly for newsletter creators of all types. Instead, it puts all ad sales, paid subscriptions and newsletter content management into a single, streamlined product.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its viewpoints on the future of newsletters — and its customer base so far — are intriguingly different from your typical SaaS startup in Silicon Valley. And there’s a reason for that. Letterhead is actually a product spinout of a community publisher in Miami called <a href="https://www.whereby.us/">WhereBy.Us</a> that began life in 2014 by launching a local media site, <a href="https://thenewtropic.com/">The New Tropic</a>. The publication became a rare success in online local news, once it focused on the email newsletter format.</p>
<p></p><div id="attachment_2090591" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090591" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2090591" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/letterhead-herogif01-large.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="511"><p id="caption-attachment-2090591" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.tryletterhead.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Letterhead <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p>
</div>
<p>“Initially, our goal was to create a local media product that would help people learn about the city, get more involved and serve a new generation of local news users,” co-founder and CEO Chris Sopher tells me by video chat. “Our ideas had included opening a bar, events and all kinds of other stuff. We quickly pared that back to the things that were working, and email was at the top of the list.”</p>
<p>Advertising inventory in these emails was in high demand, so the company built out a self-service payment system for advertisers, which allowed its newsletter writers to easily publish the correct ads in the correct place.</p>
<p>With this business model and technology as a foundation, it launched or acquired newsletters in <a href="https://theevergrey.com/">Seattle</a>, <a href="https://bridgeliner.com/">Portland</a>, <a href="https://pulp.town/">Orlando</a> and <a href="https://theincline.com/">Pittsburgh</a>. Through this process, it has continued to improve the tool itself.</p>
<p>It also discovered the broader demand.</p>
<p>“People would reach out to us and say ‘I love this newsletter, what tools do you use?’ because it was such a pain to produce emails with all of the different tools out there,” Sopher explains.</p>
<p>(Those tools, in this author’s experience, generally include a combination of Mailchimp, Constant Contact or Sailthru, together with your main web publishing CMS like WordPress, your separate subscription software like Piano and however you are managing ads.)</p>
<p>“We’d tell people that we used our own internal tools and they’d say ‘oh, can we use those, too? And we’d say ‘no, that’s not what we’re doing.’ Eventually, we said no enough that we looked at each other and said, ‘we should figure out how to get to yes on this.’ And that’s where Letterhead came from.”</p>

<p>Today, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whereby-us-the-new-tropic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whereby-us-the-new-tropic">WhereBy.Us <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is one of the few success stories from a catastrophic decade in local news. Sopher says that its five city newsletters are comfortably profitable via ads overall — having recovered from a pandemic dip earlier this year — and are continuing to grow.</p>
<p>But the new focus is on Letterhead’s tools, including the ad system, a new paid subscription feature that lets you do things like add paywalled subsections of emails, easy-to-use text editing and template formatting, and soon, analytics.</p>
<p>“Sponsorships and ads were [needs] we heard about most, so that’s where we started,” co-founder and COO Rebekah Monson said by email. “The bigger vision is to create a set of tools and services that feed into each other in one easy place, and help all of those revenue streams grow, eventually branching out from email. We’re seeing demand for that not just from traditional media publishers, but also from marketers, nonprofits, universities, professional associations — all these folks who have engaged communities and want to deepen those relationships and bring in revenue through that engagement.”</p>
<p>On the spectrum of email newsletter products, Letterhead’s focus on revenues and team collaboration places it adjacent to Substack’s focus on the individual writer, and to other products like Lede designed specifically around subscription news organizations.</p>
<p>Letterhead is explicitly a hosted software solution that you pay for your organization to use, not an open-source project like Ghost. Like how Shopify provides a suite of white-label e-commerce features for anyone who wants to run an online business, it wants to be the engine humming away under the hood of your newsletter.</p>
<p>On the much broader spectrum of all email solutions in the SaaS world, Letterhead is betting that its understanding of the market and its product design can beat out the brutally competitive world of SaaS email products.</p>

<p>Since soft-launching earlier this year, Sopher says it has already been signing up a broad range of customers. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples he cited include startups (</span><a href="https://www.shootmytravel.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shoot My Travel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), nonprofits (</span><a href="https://www.vidaysalud.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vida y Salud </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://www.refreshmiami.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refresh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and political groups (</span><a href="https://odaction.com/newsletters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OD Action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) as customers, as well as local news publishers, of course (</span><a href="https://vtdigger.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VTDigger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.choose954.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Choose954</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://santacruzlocal.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz Local</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span> Letterhead is also a partner in <a href="https://newspack.pub/">WordPress’ News Pack program</a>, which is a collection of plug-ins for publishers on that CMS.</p>
<p>“We’re always going to have an affinity to media publishing… but there is a broader need than just that industry,” he explains. “And we’re also seeing this moment where a lot of other organizations are participating in [publishing]. You name a topic, there will be professional reporters out there doing great work. But it’s also pretty likely that there is a brand, an agency, a nonprofit or some other organization creating interesting and useful content, and building a community around it — that would not raise its hand and say that it is part of the news industry.”</p>
<p>Sopher also notes that the product is designed to be modular, so that companies can just use parts of it and integrate its features with other email service providers and most any tech stack.</p>
<p>“What we’re seeing is that smaller customers are coming on for the simplicity of having it all in one place without sacrificing monetization,” he adds, “but larger customers are choosing us as one part of their stack as they build a multifaceted business or grow out of tools geared more to individual or independent creators.”</p>
<p>With the revenue options in place, Sopher says analytics and additional ESP options are coming next.</p>
<p>Over the course of its history, WhereBy.Us has raised $5 million from across tech and media. Backers include the Knight Foundation, Jason Calacanis’ LAUNCH fund, Band of Angels, McClatchy, hundreds of smaller investors via Republic and SeedInvest and, most recently, a round led by Brick Capital.</p>

<p>Austin Kleon<a href="https://austinkleon.com/2020/09/09/15-years-of-blogging-and-3-reasons-to-keep-going/"> celebrates his 15 years of blogging</a>. Here’s him quoting himself from 5 years ago:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>One little blog post is nothing on its own, but publish a thousand blog posts over a decade, and it turns into your life’s work. This blog has been my sketchbook, my studio, my gallery, my storefront, and my salon. Absolutely everything good that has happened in my career can be traced back in some way to this blog. My books, my art shows, my speaking gigs, some of my best friendships—they all exist because I have my own little piece of turf on the Internet.</p></blockquote>



<p>If I died tomorrow, I’d still be happy at the trace I’d left both online and off. 💪</p>

      <title><![CDATA[★ Online Privacy Should Be Modeled on Real-World Privacy]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l61NE0eqkw">This new ad from Apple touting iPhone privacy protection</a> is good, and genuinely funny. But what makes it funny — the premise is a series of people loudly sharing in the real world the sort of information that gets unknowingly tracked online — is actually the perfect analogy to help explain how the tracking industry — what ought to be considered the privacy theft industry — has grown into existence.</p>

<p>Consider the new ad-tracking privacy protection feature in iOS 14. The tracking industry, led by Facebook, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-says-apples-new-iphone-update-will-disrupt-online-advertising-11598458715">is up in arms about it</a> — apparently such that Apple might delay enforcing it for a few more months, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-said-to-delay-ios-change-roiling-mobile-ad-market">this report today by Alex Heath for The Information</a> (paywalled, alas — <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/03/apple-delay-ad-anti-tracking-ios-14/">here’s MacRumors’s summary</a>). Heath’s report closes thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Branch CEO Alex Austin, whose company specializes in measuring the
effectiveness of ads in mobile apps, called Apple’s proposed
change to IDFA “unworkable for the app ecosystem.”</p>

<p>“Apple’s move has gone too far, disproportionately disrupting a
vibrant app ecosystem by throwing the baby out with the
bathwater,” he told The Information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The entitlement of these fuckers is just off the charts. They have zero right, none, to the tracking they’ve been getting away with. We, as a society, have implicitly accepted it because we never really noticed it. You, the user, have no way of seeing it happen. Our brains are naturally attuned to detect and viscerally reject, with outrage and alarm, real-world intrusions into our privacy. Real-world marketers could never get away with tracking us like online marketers do.</p>

<p>Imagine if you were out shopping, went into a drug store, examined a few bottles of sunscreen, but left the store without purchasing anything. And then immediately a stranger approached you with an offer for sunscreen. Such an encounter would trigger a fight or flight reaction — the needle on your innate creepometer would shoot right into the red. (Not to mention that if real-world tracking were like online tracking, you’d get the same creepy offer to buy sunscreen <em>even if you just bought some</em>. Tracking-based offers are both creepy, and, at times, annoyingly stupid.)</p>

<p>Or imagine if you found out that public billboards were taking photos of people who glance at them, logging those photos to a database, and using facial recognition to match them with photos taken at point-of-sale terminals in retail stores. That way, if, say, you were photographed looking at an ad for a soft drink, and later — hours, days, weeks — purchased that same soft drink, the billboard advertisement you glanced at hours, days, or weeks before could get “credit” for your purchase.</p>

<p>We wouldn’t tolerate it. But that’s basically how online ad tracking works.</p>

<p>The tracking industry is correct that iOS 14 users are going to overwhelmingly deny permission to track them. That’s not because Apple’s permission dialog is unnecessarily scaring them — it’s because <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2020/09/ios-14-idfa-permission.png">Apple’s permission dialog</a> is accurately explaining what is going on in plain language, and it is repulsive. Apple’s tracking permission dialog is something no sane person would agree to because this sort of tracking <em>is</em> something no sane person would agree to.</p>

<p>Just because there is now a multi-billion-dollar industry based on the abject betrayal of our privacy doesn’t mean the sociopaths who built it have any right whatsoever to continue getting away with it. They talk in circles but their argument boils down to entitlement: they think our privacy is theirs for the taking because they’ve been getting away with taking it without our knowledge, and it is valuable. No action Apple can take against the tracking industry is too strong.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[
<p>For myself, when I read this many years from now.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>I woke up and Miranda had decorated the kitchen with giant 3-foot shiny golden balloons: 40! There was an incredibly lovely cake from Sparrow Bakery and cards that made me cry both from her and from Ruby. </p>



<p>Ruby is just 2 years old. She’s so smart and capable. There is a video of her making the card, complete with an elaborate story. She remembers everything. She makes interesting connections. She is just starting to draw things with intention and meaning. She can go on short hikes with us on her own power. It’s unreal that our tiny little girl who was born just yesterday has turned into a very real person so quickly.</p>



<p>She’s about a week into a little sleep “regression,” where she doesn’t want to sleep alone. We are not winning. She mostly sleeps with me at night in the guest bedroom. Otherwise, Miranda wouldn’t get a wink. Secretly, I don’t mind it (she’s a good snuggler), but I also don’t want it to become a thing we have to do for a long time. Toy bribery worked one night, then not the next.</p>



<p>I’ve been in back pain for about a month. There has been a tangible drop in my productivity. It’s been harder to get into deep work, because the pain pulls me out of it. It’s just muscles though, I’ll get through it. I’ve been seeing the same physical therapist I saw for my broken arms for this. I can tell he’s not into medicating. He does some light chiro stuff, stretches me out, gives me excercises. I do them, but probably only half as much as I should. I’m going to stop writing for a sec to do them.</p>



<p>That felt kinda good. I gave up today though, I gave up and went to urgent care for the pain and they gave me a shot of some kinda super Advil or whatever. It’s working a little. </p>



<p>I know why I have back pain. I sit on my ass all day. I work long hours. I’m often at work from 5:30am to 4:30pm. I feel like I have to, to stay on top of business. I’ve been going to the gym, but since the back pain started and the gym would aggravate it, I haven’t. I can’t wait to get back to going, I like that break. Miranda and I were going together for a while.</p>



<p>Worse than the sitting, I’m overweight. I’d say the last year hasn’t been kind to me in that regard, with the broken arms and all. The arms are still a bit messed up, but it’s not blocker for much anymore. It’s a food thing. It’s always been a food thing. I need to eat less (and more healthy) food, and then never stop doing that the rest of my life. Like any addict, I need to stop the bad eating entirely. </p>



<p>Then there is the whole pandemic thing. See, COVID-19 has been raging and killing lots of people. Only 11 deaths in my county, but 436 in the state, and headed toward 200,000 in the country. We’re in this weird position where we thought we had it beat, and the country started “opening” again (loads of businesses literally closed and tons of people are working from home) and then it turned out we definitely do <em>not</em> have it beat, but we’re just kinda staying open anyway and waiting it out. It’s become highly politicized, of course. </p>



<p>Did I mention we’re only 60 days from the Trump/Pence vs. Biden/Harris presidential election? That has us all in an emotional mess too. I find Trump to be abhorrent. Quite literally a terrible person. I remember the first time I saw him pick out an individual American citizen to pick on and was shocked. Now he’s done that, what, hundreds of times? He’s not a leader, and I want a leader. I don’t particularly like Biden, but I like the joke I read yesterday. It went something like choosing between airline meals, and one of them is dog shit with glass shards in it and the other is the chicken. To question if you’re going to vote for Biden is like pausing before deciding between those meals to say “how is the chicken cooked?”</p>



<p>Oh and one more thing. People in America have extremely had it with the killing of black people. The murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor were the biggest sparks this time.  It’s gotta stop. The Black Lives Matter movement is raging. There are worldwide protests. There are even protests here in Bend, Oregon and the smaller towns around us. ICE showed up the other day and that drew an even bigger protest. In Portland, the protests have gotten so heated there has been federal involvement. </p>



<p>In my home state of Wisconsin, there was a shooting the other night that has stirred up more protests all over the state. I just looked at pictures of citizens literally pointing guns at each other in the street. </p>



<p>My dad called me for my birthday. We talked about Ruby. We talked about my back a little. Then we talked about the protests. He drives my step mom to work and back each day, and he sees the destruction that happens in the streets. Businesses that have already struggled through COVID now getting their windows smashed in. Whole streets with boarded-up windows. </p>



<p>I don’t know what to think, most days. I want a leader. I want to be healthy. I want everyone to be healthy. I don’t want to see anything collapse because we don’t have the leaders we need in the places we need them.</p>



<p>Happy birthday, bud.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p><em>(Thanks for all the birthday well-wishes, everyone. They’ve been coming at me right and left today and it’s really heartwarming especially during this time that is so isolating.)</em></p>

<p>I work remotely and have for many years, but let’s be honest: it’s the case for a lot of people now. Lately I’ve been trying to step up how my home office looks, especially with regards to its video conferencing capabilities. <a href="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/2020/05/20/how-to-use-a-dslr-as-a-webcam-on-a-mac/">I started using a DSLR as my webcam</a> along with a ring light and dimmable room lights. With the basics out of the way, I next wanted to work on my office’s background by installing LED light strips below each my office’s bookshelves.</p>

<p>If you’ve watched YouTube or Twitch streamers, you might have noticed they have interesting backgrounds behind them, often with colored LED lighting on shelves or in corners. My new home office has a bunch of built-in floating shelves and I thought it’d be a perfect place to install LED strips.</p>



<h2>LEDs are ample, ubiquitous, and cheap</h2>



<p>LEDs are amazing. They’re incredibly bright while also using low power. Modern technology has incorporated them into almost everything and that’s driven the price for light strips ridiculously low. What you see in my final product in the photo above cost about $100 total for 45 feet (15m) of light, including a hard-wired controller, all the wiring, and the power supply.</p>



<p><strong>BIG NOTE UP FRONT</strong>: You can buy great pre-built, consumer grade LED light strips that come with a remote control, can be controlled by your phone, and are relatively cheap. Personally, I’ve purchased <a href="https://amzn.to/2WzO7F1">a few Govee light strips like this long one</a> and they work great for simple applications like on a shelf, or around a door jam, or up on a crown molding. For 90% of most people’s needs, that’s the best and easiest way to go. </p>



<p>Since I had six shelves, I didn’t want to have to manage six plugs, so what I’m describing here is going the full-on DIY route, cutting your LED strips up, using a solder gun, and creating the exact lights you need for your space. Here’s how I did mine.</p>



<h2>Buy some WS2812B strips</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-rich wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div data-carousel-extra='{"blog_id":134481598,"permalink":"https:\/\/a.wholelottanothing.org\/2020\/07\/18\/building-diy-led-strips-for-fun\/"}' class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe class="youtube-player" width="1100" height="619" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QnvircC22hU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>This video is a fantastic overview of all the options when it comes to LED strips, but the long-story-short is WS2812B is the standard designation for a simple, individually addressable string of LED lights. I bought mine with no waterproofing (since they’re used indoors) and I got them in 30 pixels/meter density to keep my power needs low. Typically you’d pay about $10 for a 6 foot (2m) string and 16 foot (5m) strings are about $20. They’re all over eBay, <a href="https://amzn.to/3hqC0lZ">Amazon</a>, and Aliexpress (which is the cheapest but can take the longest to arrive).</p>



<p>Light strips come with a simple adhesive sticky backing to mount under things, but I went a little extra and bought some <a href="https://amzn.to/2DU5pWZ">aluminum channel designed for LEDs</a> that also comes with a diffuser panel that helps spread out the light. You screw them into something, stick your LED strips inside, then snap on the outside light diffuser for a more permanent installation.</p>



<p>I also finished off my mounting by putting <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Royal-Mouldings-Limited-96-in-PVC/1000444739">this corner guard</a> in front of the lights to both hide the aluminum strip and further diffuse the light on the upper three shelves. It gives a nice downward glow.</p>



<h2>Next, buy and prepare your controller</h2>



<p>Your lights will be controlled by a tiny computer chip with a WiFi adapter in it and the one you want is a NodeMCU ESP8266. The great part is they’re only about three or four bucks each and I bought <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZFQUhQ">this set of three at Amazon</a> just in case I fried one along the way<a href="https://amzn.to/2ZFQUhQ">.</a> <a href="https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED">Download WLED software</a> and flash it to your NodeMCU, then configure it onto your WiFi network. All of it is covered in this step-by-step video to building your first light strip. If you buy the things you need, just follow Dr Zz’s guide closely to get them all working (it’s how I did mine).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-rich wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div data-carousel-extra='{"blog_id":134481598,"permalink":"https:\/\/a.wholelottanothing.org\/2020\/07\/18\/building-diy-led-strips-for-fun\/"}' class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe class="youtube-player" width="1100" height="619" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tXvtxwK3jRk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2>Wire it together with a power supply</h2>



<p>The above video also goes into the math around how to select a power supply for your LEDs. You’ll also have to pay attention to the voltage in your system. I went with 5V LED strips for all the reasons stated above (lower power needs, cheaper strips), but make sure you use 5V everything, including your power supply, your NodeMCU, and all your wired connections.</p>



<p>My strips all together total 400 LEDs so I needed a pretty big power supply. I bought <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZDYmtU">this 30 amp model</a> that is fanless and runs cool. My first purchase was a 60 amp power supply with a giant fan but it sounded like a hair dryer when you plugged it in and I’d only suggest using those for outdoor applications.</p>



<p>I used <a href="https://amzn.to/30psjgr">basic red/black wire</a> for dropping power on each strip’s end. I used <a href="https://amzn.to/2CKkbiG">some LED wire</a> to connect them all together back to the controller. I avoided a lot of soldering by using <a href="https://amzn.to/2DO5paX">these specially made connectors</a> that fit my LED strips perfectly. I also used <a href="https://amzn.to/39bKTwQ">these T-connectors</a> for connecting additional power while reducing the amount of soldering needed. <a href="https://amzn.to/2WwEB5O">A set of jumper wires</a> is needed to quickly connect up your NodeMCU to your power supply.</p>



<h2>Fire up your phone and enjoy your lights</h2>

<p>Download and install the WLED app for your phone and you should be able to control your lights after some configuration (don’t forget to input the exact number of LEDs you have and play with your LED preferences). You can also control them from a desktop web browser by simply going to your controller’s internal IP address. </p>



<p>WLED is pretty incredible since it comes with a couple hundred different patterns already built-in and you simply select them to make your lights run complex patterns. I’ve customized my setup to split each bookshelf’s strip into its own segment, so programmed light effects happen on every shelf at once.</p>



<p>I’ve also added my light strips to my Homekit control by using a WLED homebridge plugin so I can turn them off or on from my phone inside or outside my house, and as part of routines. Currently, I’m working on an iOS Shortcut to automatically dim <a href="https://amzn.to/2CLa2lG">my room’s Hue lights</a> and turn on the LED strips whenever I connect my AirPods to my laptop (which is when I’m about to jump into a Zoom meeting).</p>



<p>To complete the look for my office, I added <a href="https://amzn.to/398uE3z">a Samsung Frame 55″ TV</a> I flush wall mounted that I turn on each morning to display Samsung’s art prints, which I rotate out often. The Frame TV is pretty incredible, with a screen that has a matte finish and it really does look like a painting to the naked eye, though when photographing it, it tends to overstate the brightness making it look more like a bright TV. If I had one TV in my living room over a fireplace mantel, I’d totally buy one of these, since it looks great when you’re not watching TV.</p>

<p>I’ve got the LEDs set to a rainbow routine that I’ve slowed down, and they gently change in the background of my meetings.</p>



<p>Again, if you have a simple setup, just go with an off-the-shelf option like the Govee lights, but if you want to go fully custom, LED strips are a fun cheap way to add some color to your surroundings.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[The Slack Social Network]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="podcastlinks"><a href="https://stratechery.com/podcasts/">Manage your Stratechery subscription.</a></div>
<p>On November 2, 2016, Microsoft <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/november-2016-event/">announced Teams</a> at a special event in New York City. Slack decided to mark the occasion:</p>
<div align="center">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">That feeling when you think "we should buy a full page in the Times and publish an open letter," and then you do. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4ab.png" alt="💫" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"> <a href="https://t.co/BQiEawRA6d">pic.twitter.com/BQiEawRA6d</a></p>
<p>— Stewart Butterfield (@stewart) <a href="https://twitter.com/stewart/status/793811616760496128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2016</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
</div>
<p>The <a href="https://slackhq.com/dear-microsoft">text of the ad</a> was condescension cloaked in congratulations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>  Wow. Big news! Congratulations on today’s announcements. We’re genuinely excited to have some competition.</p>
<p>  We realized a few years ago that the value of switching to Slack was so obvious and the advantages so overwhelming that every business would be using Slack, or “something just like it,” within the decade. It’s validating to see you’ve come around to the same way of thinking. And even though — being honest here — it’s a little scary, we know it will bring a better future forward faster.</p>
<p>  However, all this is harder than it looks. So, as you set out to build “something just like it,” we want to give you some friendly advice.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Slack’s “advice” was, naturally, self-serving, at least in terms of how the startup saw their advantages relative to Microsoft; to quote the ad:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not the features that matter</li>
<li>An open platform is essential</li>
<li>You’ve got to do this with love</li>
</ul>
<p>The advertisement added under that last point:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We love our work, and when we say our mission is to make people’s working lives simpler, more pleasant, and more productive, we’re not simply mouthing the words. If you want customers to switch to your product, you’re going to have to match our commitment to their success and take the same amount of delight in their happiness.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Two-and-a-half years later <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/11/microsoft-teams-passes-slack-in-daily-users-rajesh-jha-explains-why.html">Teams passed Slack</a> in daily active users (DAUs). On the company’s last earnings call CEO Satya Nadella revealed that Teams had 75 million daily active users; Slack hasn’t provided a post-pandemic-onset DAU number, but had 12 million <a href="https://slackhq.com/work-is-fueled-by-true-engagement">last October</a> (Microsoft’s pre-pandemic number was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/18/microsoft-teams-app-reaches-44-million-daily-users.html">32 million in early March</a>). And while Slack’s ad may have welcomed Microsoft as a competitor, now CEO Stewart Butterfield is saying that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3CpVK83az4">Teams isn’t a competitor after all</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Slack, that is increasingly true.</p>
<h4>Microsoft Strikes Back</h4>
<p>I have long quipped that most of Silicon Valley has serially underestimated Facebook because it is the social network of friends and family, and many people in tech are trying to escape said friends and family. You can say the same thing about Microsoft: while the company was once the disruptive upstart, for decades it has been the default for all of those businesses that Silicon Valley is seeking to disrupt. Ergo, if those businesses are surely doomed, then so is Microsoft.</p>
<p>Moreover, just as Twitter is the social network of choice within the tech ecosystem, the vast majority of Silicon Valley companies host their email with Google and use Google’s productivity software, or one of the myriad of offerings seeking to usurp documents or spreadsheets or presentations. And even when it comes to the cloud, the choice for startups is usually between AWS and Google Cloud Platform. Microsoft is out-of-sight and out-of-mind.</p>
<p>And then something mysterious occurs; an enterprise SaaS company will grow like a weed, getting buzz amongst investors and the press that covers them, raise rounds for growth, perhaps even IPO, and then, well, Teams versus Slack happens:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/20028/daily-active-users-of-slack-and-microsoft-teams/"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/slack-2.png" alt="Teams versus Slack growth" width="640" height="456" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5101" srcset="http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/slack-2.png 960w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/slack-2-300x214.png 300w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/slack-2-768x547.png 768w, http://2yj23r14cytosbxol4cavq33.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/slack-2-884x630.png 884w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></p>
<p>The obvious reason for Teams’ success relative to Slack is the oldest tactic in the book: Teams is free, and Slack isn’t. Well, technically, Teams requires a<strike>n Office</strike> Microsoft 365 subscription (although yes, there are free versions of both Teams and Slack), but as Slack itself notes, a good portion of its addressable market has exactly that. In other words, the effective choice is exactly what I stated: “free” versus paid.</p>
<p>Moreover, while Slack concluded its advertisement by talking about how difficult it would be for Microsoft to convince Slack users to “switch” to Teams, switching was never the goal: just as Facebook created Instagram Stories <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-audacity-of-copying-well/">to remove the impetus for new users to even try Snapchat</a>, Teams is particularly effective as a way to prevent a Microsoft customer from even trying Slack. And, in that case, it doesn’t matter how much “love” Slack put into its product: said love was not simply unrequited, but unexperienced.</p>
<p>Still, it is not as if all of those Teams users started using the program because they were inspired by Slack: Microsoft has a huge sales team with relationships that go back years, and a massive partner network that serves companies that are too small to sell to directly; I wrote about the latter <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/microsofts-earnings-teams-passes-slack-the-partner-advantage/">when Teams passed Slack</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  I am sure it was not a coincidence that this announcement happened in the middle of Microsoft’s annual partner conference in Las Vegas. Most of the media pays much more attention to Microsoft’s Build developer conference in the spring, but that is because writing about products is much easier than writing about ecosystems, particularly when it comes to enterprise.</p>
<p>  Microsoft’s partner network is a truly gargantuan moat. When it comes to enterprise, it is easy to focus on the biggest companies, where Microsoft will engage directly, and challengers like Slack can build up sales forces to compete. Underneath those companies, though, are tens of thousands of smaller businesses that, even if they have IT directors of their own, rely on outside vendors to build up their technical infrastructure. Here Microsoft has invested heavily in training and equipping these vendors; critically, the company also overhauled its incentive program such that it shares its subscription revenue for Azure and Office 365 with its partners, as opposed to one-off payments for acquiring customers.</p>
<p>  The result is that these partners are heavily motivated to offer and implement Microsoft-centric solutions: not only does everything (generally) work together, they also make more money in the process. This, then, is the context of the Teams daily active users announcement: Microsoft wasn’t simply pounding its chest, it was sending a message to its partners that pushing Teams is a winning strategy.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key is integration.</p>
<h4>Microsoft’s Integration</h4>
<p>Any discussion of integration and modularization in the context of technology inevitably casts Microsoft as the ultimate example of the latter, particularly relative to Apple. In truth, though, while Windows ran on whatever hardware you wished to throw at it, the company’s software products have always been designed to work together, particularly in the enterprise. Windows Server came with Active Directory, which undergirded Microsoft Exchange, which users accessed via Outlook on their Windows computers that, of course, ran the rest of the Office suite better than anything else. It was, frankly, a pain in the rear end to try and switch out any of the pieces, which Microsoft leveraged to not only lock in its position, but also drive continual upgrades, which it used to justify subscription pricing years before the rest of Silicon Valley discovered the SaaS business model.</p>
<p>The combination of cloud and mobile started to break this integration apart: Microsoft’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/services-not-devices/">misguided Windows-centric strategy</a> meant that Office wasn’t available on the dominant mobile platforms, which drove companies to search out cloud-based alternatives, which made them much easier to both trial and support. That is why it was so important that Satya Nadella’s first public appearance as CEO was <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/when-ceos-matter/">announcing Office for iPad</a>, and why his greatest triumph was <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-end-of-windows/">The End of Windows</a>.</p>
<p>The end of Windows as the center of Microsoft’s approach, and the shift to the cloud, though, did not mean the end of Microsoft’s focus on integration, or its attempt to be an operating system; the company simply changed its definition of what an operating system was; Satya Nadella said at <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/satya-nadella-on-microsoft/">a press briefing in 2019</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  The other effort for us is what we describe as Microsoft 365. What we are trying to do is bring home that notion that it’s about the user, the user is going to have relationships with other users and other people, they’re going to have a bunch of artifacts, their schedules, their projects, their documents, many other things, their to-do’s, and they are going to use a variety of different devices. That’s what Microsoft 365 is all about.</p>
<p>  Sometimes I think the new OS is not going to start from the hardware, because the classic OS definition, that Tanenbaum, one of the guys who wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Operating_Systems">the book on Operating Systems</a> that I read when I went to school was: “It does two things, it abstracts hardware, and it creates an app model”. Right now the abstraction of hardware has to start by abstracting <em>all</em> of the hardware in your life, so the notion that this is one device is interesting and important, it doesn’t mean the kernel that boots your device just goes away, it still exists, but the point of real relevance I think in our lives is “hey, what’s that abstraction of all the hardware in my life that I use?” – some of it is shared, some of it is personal. And then, what’s the app model for it? How do I write an experience that transcends all of that hardware? And that’s really what our pursuit of Microsoft 365 is all about.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is where Teams thrives: if you fully commit to the Microsoft ecosystem, one app combines your contacts, conversations, phone calls, access to files, 3rd-party applications, in a way that “just works”; I explained my personal experience with Teams in a <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/apples-china-patent-case-slack-versus-teams-stratechery-llcs-choice/">December 2018 Daily Update</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Here’s the thing, though: Dropbox absolutely is better than One Drive. Google Apps are better at collaboration than Microsoft’s Office apps. Asana is better than Planner. And, to be very clear, Slack is massively better than Teams at chat. Using all of them together, though, well, it sucks: the user experience that matters for me is not any one app but all of them at once, and for the way I want to work, having everything organized in one single place is simply better (and that’s even with the normal spate of maddening Microsoft UI oddities!). In this Teams is less a chat app than it is a file explorer for the cloud generally, and Stratechery LLC specifically.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is what Slack — and Silicon Valley, generally — failed to understand about Microsoft’s competitive advantage: the company doesn’t win just because it bundles, or because it has a superior ground game. By virtue of doing everything, even if mediocrely, the company is providing a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts, particularly for the non-tech workers that are in fact most of the market. Slack may have infused its chat client with love, but chatting is a means to an end, and Microsoft often seems like the only enterprise company that understands that.</p>
<h4>Slack Connect</h4>
<p>This left Slack in a very vulnerable position: Teams was “free”, supported by Microsoft’s sales teams and partner network, and, from a certain perspective, was actually easier to use. Unless your job was to chat all day, why choose Slack? In fact, that was the solution: what Slack has done over the last few years is make chat itself into a moat, not just by being better at it, but by expanding who it is you can chat with.</p>
<p>The key piece is Shared Channels, which <a href="https://slackhq.com/slack-shared-channels">officially launched in 2019</a>, after a seemingly interminable two-year beta period. From the <a href="https://slackhq.com/slack-shared-channels">announcement on Slack’s blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  Millions of people use Slack every day as a better way to get work done: with faster and more effective collaboration, deeper connections with colleagues, and seamless integrations with the apps and programs we use every day. But what about all the work that happens outside our organizations—with vendors, partners, contractors? Why compromise there?</p>
<p>  For that, there’s shared channels, a new feature that allows Slack teams in different organizations to use Slack to collaborate together as easily and productively as they do internally. It’s officially out of beta today and available for all paid plans.</p>
<p>  A shared channel works just like a normal Slack channel, only now connecting organizations. This means a team from Company A is communicating in the same Slack channel as their partners at Company B. New people coming into a project can readily access a project’s archive, allowing them to ramp up swiftly. Teams can easily share updates and files, loop in the right people, and quickly make decisions—all from a single place in Slack.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shared Channels are a far more compelling feature than Slack’s attempt at a platform, particularly when it comes to accentuating the ways in which Slack is better than Teams. First, chat is the point, not integrating with toolchains that are probably different on a company-by-company basis, which lets Slack’s strengths as a chat client come to the forefront. Second, because Slack is <em>not</em> deeply integrated with a bunch of other applications, it is actually easier for it to horizontally connect different companies. Third, being first actually matters.</p>
<p>Consider Slack Connect, which the company announced <a href="https://slackhq.com/slack-connect">late last month</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  For years, Slack has been changing the way millions of people work together within their organizations. By shifting internal communication out of inboxes and into channels, teams can work more transparently with each other and get more done. But we know the work doesn’t stop at a company’s walls. That’s why today, we’re taking the next step and bringing all the benefits of Slack to everyone you work with, both inside and outside your organization. Introducing <a href="http://www.slack.com/connect">Slack Connect</a>: a more secure and productive way for organizations to communicate together.</p>
<p>  More than four years in the making and developed with customers, Slack Connect is a secure communications environment that lets you move all the conversations with your external partners, clients, vendors and others into Slack, replacing email and taking business collaboration to the next level…Starting today, up to 20 organizations can come together in a single Slack channel, enabling customers to bring even more of their external ecosystem into Slack—such as their entire supply chain, corporate subsidiaries or industry peers.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Slack Connect is about more than chat: not only can you have multiple companies in one channel, you can also manage the flow of data between different organizations; to put it another way, while Microsoft is busy building an operating system in the cloud, Slack has decided to build the enterprise social network. Or, to put it in visual terms, Microsoft is a vertical company, and Slack has gone fully horizontal:</p>

<p>This doubles down on all of the advantages of shared channels. The user experience of chat specifically is what matters; the only reason this is even possible is because Slack is focused on one specific part of the stack, and the more companies that take advantage of Slack Connect the more of a moat Slack has. That’s the thing about social networks: their best feature is whether or not your friends are on it, or, in this case, whether or not the companies you are working with are using Slack.</p>
<p>I certainly find it compelling: it is hard to imagine how the <a href="https://stratechery.com/podcasts">Stratechery podcast service</a> would have been built without shared channels, which means that yes, I pay for both Microsoft 365 and Slack, and happily so. Moreover, I can’t imagine ever <em>not</em> paying — Stratechery LLC is already tied into 4 other companies, and that number will only go up. It appears that Slack has learned the lesson all successful companies must learn: idealistic statements — or advertisements — about building with “love” are a lot less useful than actually understanding what solutions you can build that both solve customer problems and give your product a moat in the process.</p>
<hr>
<p>Slack’s shift into being an enterprise social network is not necessarily bad news for Microsoft; if anything it removes a potential contender for the enterprise cloud OS. It does, though, raise the question of who will actually build the modular alternative to Microsoft?</p>
<p>The obvious answer is Google: the company has both the resources and, in the case of G Suite, the core products to do so. The biggest obstacle is that the search company is the exception that proves the rule: Google search won simply by being better, in a market that was both desperate for what the company built, and completely open. A better search engine really was just a click away.</p>
<p>The problem this presents to Google’s enterprise efforts is that the company has never learned how to listen to customers, how to sell, or how to build an ecosystem. Yes, Android has as many apps as you might want, but that is more a function of just how massive the mobile opportunity is (which is why Apple can be a rent-seeking platform for developers yet have a huge ecosystem). Creating a full stack alternative to Microsoft filled with best-of-breed apps will require capabilities that Google has never really demonstrated.</p>
<p>For that reason, while Microsoft still needs to learn <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/microsoft-slack-zoom-and-the-saas-opportunity/">how to capture new companies</a>, its moat with most of the enterprise market appears as strong as ever; Slack deserves credit for carving out its own.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Feeds]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[

<p>A little while back, Marcus Herrmann wrote about <a href="https://marcus.io/blog/making-rss-more-visible-again-with-slash-feeds">making RSS more visible again with a <code>/feeds</code> page</a>. Here’s <a href="https://marcus.io/feeds">his feeds page</a>. Here’s <a href="https://remysharp.com/feeds">Remy’s</a>.</p>

<p>Seems like a good idea to me. I’ve made mine:</p>

<p><a href="https://adactio.com/feeds">adactio.com/feeds</a></p>

<p>As well as linking to the usual RSS feeds (blog posts, links, notes), it’s also got an explanation of how <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/14120">you can subscribe to a customised RSS feed using tags</a>.</p>

<p>Then, earlier today, I was chatting with <a href="http://interconnected.org/">Matt</a> on Twitter and <a href="https://twitter.com/genmon/status/1279406341988237314">he asked</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>btw do you share your blogroll anywhere?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now I’ve added another URL:</p>

<p><a href="https://adactio.com/feeds/subscriptions">adactio.com/feeds/subscriptions</a></p>

<p>That’s got a link to <a href="https://adactio.com/feeds/subscriptions/adactio.opml">my OPML file</a>, exported from <a href="https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">my feed reader</a>, and a list of the (current) RSS feeds that I’m subscribed to.</p>

<p>I like the idea of blogrolls making a comeback. <a href="https://weirdwidewebring.net/">And webrings</a>.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Not fully transparent]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[
  <p>Has anyone explained why Apple is touting the translucent menu bar in Big Sur? Craig Federighi pointed it out in the keynote last week, and either Bob Borchers or Ronak Shah (I can’t remember which) mentioned it their interview on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/304">this week’s Upgrade</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Big Sur menu bar" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200701-Big%20Sur%20menu%20bar.jpg" title="Big Sur menu bar" width="80%"></p>
<p>It is, of course, an awful feature, an impediment to usability because it makes the menu bar harder to read. Even Apple’s own PR screenshots have terrible contrast. But Apple has obviously abandoned “design is how it works” in favor of “that looks so cool, dude,”<sup id="fnref:e"><a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2020/07/not-fully-transparent/#fn:e" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> so that’s not the reason I’m surprised to be hearing about it.</p>
<p>No, I’m surprised to be hearing about it now because the translucent menu bar is a really old feature. It was introduced in <em>Leopard</em>, which means it’s been around almost as long as Intel Macs… and is clearly going to outlive them.</p>
<p>So I’m suspicious of this promotion of an old feature as if it were new. When Apple sends people out to talk, it expects them to stay on-message, and the translucent menu bar is apparently part of the message of Big Sur. And because I can’t figure out why they’re doing this, I feel myself sinking into paranoia (they’re not going to take away the Accessibility setting that turns this abomination off, are they?) and Kremlinology.</p>
<div class="update">
<p><strong>Update Jul 1, 2020 12:20 PM</strong>  
Jason Snell tells me the difference in Big Sur’s menu bar is that it’s even closer to transparent than before. Great. At least we can still turn it off.</p>
</div>
<div class="update">
<p><strong>Update Jul 1, 2020 11:45 PM</strong>  
I see, from <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/07/01/upgrade-inteviews-bob-borchers-and-ronak-shah/">Michael Tsai’s link</a> that Craig Hockenberry has been tracking the menu bar transparency fiasco <a href="https://furbo.org/2007/06/28/maybe-that-transparency-is-not-such-a-good-idea/">from the beginning</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of Apple’s design decisions—Dark Mode comes to mind—suggest to me that it’s been taken over by people who, when they were teenagers, were big fans of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_(software)">Enlightenment window manager</a> and whose taste has not improved with age. <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2020/07/not-fully-transparent/#fnref:e" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>

      <title><![CDATA[Canada to Launch Nationwide COVID-19 Contact Tracing App Based on Apple/Google Technology]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau today announced that Canada plans to launch a nationwide COVID-19 contract tracing app based on Apple's and Google's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/exposure-notification/">Exposure Notification API</a>, as noted by <em><a href="https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/canada-apple-google-contact-tracing-ontario-trudeau/">iPhone in Canada</a></em>. Trudeau said the app is slated for release in early July, with testing set to begin in Ontario soon.

<br>
Canada will join a growing list of countries that have committed to using the API, including the United Kingdom, Italy, Latvia, Switzerland, Germany, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and others. At least three U.S. states are also adopting the solution.
<br>

<br>
Built into iOS 13.5 on the Apple side, the API allows iPhones and Android smartphones to interface with one another for contact tracing purposes. If and when you happen to be nearby someone who later tests positive for COVID-19, you can receive a notification and take the appropriate steps to self isolate and seek medical help if necessary.
<br>

<br>
Apple and Google have stressed the privacy of their Bluetooth-based solution, which must be enabled in the Settings app under Privacy &gt; Health &gt; COVID-19 Exposure Logging to function.
